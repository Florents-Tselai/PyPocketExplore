            "text": "Illustration by Jim Cooke\n\nWe\u2019re kicking off Sex Ed for Grown-Ups with a reality check on what\u2019s normal, sex-wise. Take a minute to think about when you had sex for the first time, how much sex you have, and whether you think other people are doing it more or less than you. Chances are, you\u2019re more normal than you think.\n\nFirst of all, before you start to feel self conscious, however much you have sex is fine. We\u2019re not here to judge. And to the young folks reading this: you\u2019re not a bad person if you\u2019ve done it already, and you\u2019re not a prude or somehow cursed if you keep your pants on until another stage in your life. We\u2019re about to see that there\u2019s a huge range in what\u2019s normal.\n\nThat said, if you\u2019re having a lot of unprotected sex and you\u2019re at risk of STDs or pregnancy, then the issue is the lack of protection, not the amount of sex. And if you\u2019re not happy with the relationship you\u2019re in, the amount of sex you\u2019re having might be a factor, but don\u2019t judge yourself (or your partner) based solely on that one thing. You need to look at that relationship in a big-picture way. Are you happy? Why or why not?\n\nWhere Does This Data Come From?\n\nAnyway. Back to comparing ourselves to others. This is tricky to do, because you can ask people in surveys, but how do you know they\u2019re telling the truth? One of our best sources of information is the National Survey of Family Growth, administered by the US government\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics to get a handle on all kinds of issues related to sex and reproductive health. They divide up the country into units based on census blocks, choose households within those blocks, and interview one person from each household (so long as they are between the ages of 15 and 44 and agree to be interviewed), and ask them tons of personal questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can see the questionnaire here. A survey worker comes to the person\u2019s house and asks them questions for the first part of the interview; then they hand over their laptop and leave the room while the respondent answers all the personal questions. Those include when they first started having sex, whether they\u2019ve been raped, how many pregnancies they\u2019ve really had, and more. These answers will never be read by a human; the computer locks them away so the interviewer can\u2019t see. This is where we get the answers to the first few questions we\u2019re asking today. You can check out a more complete report here.\n\nWhen Do People Start Having Sex?\n\nAbout half of us have had sex (penis in vagina sex, specifically) by age 17 or so. Here\u2019s the age breakdown:\n\nSo, by age 15, 13 percent of females and 18 percent of males have had vaginal intercourse. By age 19, those figures stand at 68 and 69 percent. That means if you lost your virginity in your teens, you\u2019re in good company; but if you didn\u2019t, a good 30 percent of Americans are right there with you.\n\nHow Many Sex Partners Do Adults Have?\n\nOnce we hit adulthood, most people are having some kind of sex. For 20 to 24-year-olds, the number not having sex is just 16 percent of women and 18 percent of men. (For teenagers, it\u2019s about half, which makes sense given the virginity statistics above.)\n\nSince we\u2019re looking at grown-ups today, let\u2019s take a closer look at the 25 to 44 age group. People were asked who their sex partners were in the past year. This counts any type of sexual experience. Here\u2019s what they said:\n\nNo recent sex partners : 7 percent\n\n: 7 percent Any number of same-sex partners: 5 percent of men, 11 percent of women\n\n5 percent of men, 11 percent of women One opposite-sex partner (and no same-sex partners): 73 percent\n\n(and no same-sex partners): 73 percent Multiple opposite-sex partners (and no same-sex partners): 14 percent of men, 6 percent of women\n\nThere wasn\u2019t a direct question for people who had both opposite and same sex partners, but about 2 percent didn\u2019t answer yes to any of the above.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSponsored\n\nThe survey also asked about lifetime opposite-sex partners, and here it makes the most sense to look at the oldest age group: the 40 to 44 year olds. (Think about it: 25 year olds should have fewer lifetime partners than 40 year olds, just because they haven\u2019t had as long a lifetime so far.) The median number of opposite-sex partners is 3.4 for women, and 6.4 for men. That means half of the respondents had more partners, and half had less. Here\u2019s the full breakdown:\n\nNo opposite-sex partners : women, 0.4 percent; men, 1.3 percent\n\n: women, 0.4 percent; men, 1.3 percent One opposite-sex partner : women, 22 percent; men, 10 percent\n\n: women, 22 percent; men, 10 percent Three to six opposite-sex partners : women, 40 percent; men, 30 percent\n\n: women, 40 percent; men, 30 percent Fifteen or more: women, 8 percent; men, 30 percent\n\nIf we look at what kinds of sex people say they have had, going back to that larger 25-44 age group, the numbers look like this:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAny same-sex experience : women, 12 percent; men, 6 percent.\n\n: women, 12 percent; men, 6 percent. Any opposite-sex experience : women and men, both 98 percent.\n\n: women and men, both 98 percent. Vaginal intercourse : women, 98 percent; men, 97 percent\n\n: women, 98 percent; men, 97 percent Oral sex with an opposite-sex partner : women, 89 percent; men, 90 percent\n\n: women, 89 percent; men, 90 percent Anal sex with an opposite-sex partner: women, 36 percent; men, 44 percent\n\nHow Often Do People Have Sex?\n\nAccording to the General Social Survey, the average American adult has sex about 60 times per year, so a little more than once a week. (This survey is done with face-to-face interviews.) If that\u2019s not you, don\u2019t despair: people in this study who didn\u2019t have sex in the past year were just as happy as people who had.\n\nFrequency of sex changes over a person\u2019s lifetime. As we saw, teenagers and young adults aren\u2019t all having sex, but once they reach their twenties and thirties, they do it plenty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite a lot of buzz about \u201chookup culture,\u201d young people in 2004-2012 didn\u2019t have any more sex than their counterparts in 1988-1996. They were, however, less likely to be in a steady relationship with the people they slept with.\n\nIn old age, people have less sex. Some of this is because older people lose their partners and don\u2019t necessarily start dating again. But being in poor health, or on certain medications, can also make people less interested in sex. Here\u2019s how a Journals of Gerontology study summarized the situation, using data from two other surveys, the National Health and Social Life Survey and the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAge 44-59:\n\nSexually active: men, 88 percent; women, 72 percent.\n\nmen, 88 percent; women, 72 percent. Sex per month (if more than zero): men, 7 times; women, 6.5 times.\n\nAge 57-72:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSexually active: men, 72 percent; women, 45 percent.\n\nmen, 72 percent; women, 45 percent. Sex per month (if more than zero): men, 4.3 times; women, 3.8 times.\n\nFor a different way of looking at the question, the National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior asked people what sex acts they had done in the past month, past year, and ever in their lifetime. This study was done over the internet, but they selected a sample before approaching anybody with the link to the study. (That makes this different than lazy internet polls where you never know who\u2019s clicking through.) Here\u2019s a summary of the past-year data:\n\nIf we want to know how often people are doing it, the past-month data will give us better insights. You can check out the full results here. Let\u2019s take a look at what the 25 to 29 year olds said they did:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMasturbation : 69 percent of men, 52 percent of women\n\n\n\n: 69 percent of men, 52 percent of women Vaginal intercourse : 74 percent of both men and women\n\n\n\n: 74 percent of both men and women Received oral from a female : 46 percent of men, 5 percent of women\n\n: 46 percent of men, 5 percent of women Gave oral to a female : 40 percent of men, 1.1 percent of women\n\n: 40 percent of men, 1.1 percent of women Received oral from a male : 1.2 percent of men, 36 percent of women\n\n: 1.2 percent of men, 36 percent of women Gave oral to a male : 2.7 percent of men, 50 percent of women\n\n: 2.7 percent of men, 50 percent of women Received anal sex : 0.9 percent of men, 5.3 percent of women\n\n: 0.9 percent of men, 5.3 percent of women Inserted their penis into someone else\u2019s anus: 10 percent of men\n\nFor any of these acts, there are plenty of people who do the thing and plenty who don\u2019t do the thing; so no shame in being in either category.\n\nHow Do We Know If People Are Telling the Truth?\n\nYou would probably reveal different things about your sexual history to a close friend than a casual one. You might be more willing to be honest on an anonymous web survey\u2014but then again, you might also be more likely to make shit up for fun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe National Survey of Family Growth is clever with their confidential self-surveying portion, but a British study found that people were more likely to admit to certain things\u2014large numbers of sexual partners, use of drugs\u2014on a web survey than on a survey done privately on an interviewer\u2019s laptop.\n\nIf people are lying on these surveys, it\u2019s going to be difficult to find a more accurate source of information. Seth Stephens-Davidowitz sees a different picture of sexuality when he looks at Google search data: for example, he found that \u201csexless marriage\u201d is one of the more popular marriage-related searches. There are plenty of caveats with his data: we don\u2019t know who is doing the searches, or why. We have no clue how they compare to people who don\u2019t search for these terms. But they\u2019re a good reminder to take data about sexual behavior with a large grain of salt.\n\nI ended up searching for a lot of sex-related statistics as I researched this piece, and discovered something unsettling about the results. When I looked for information about how often people have sex, I found plenty of articles assuming I wanted to know how often people should have sex.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou should have sex whenever you please. There\u2019s no shame in doing it a lot or a little! People in unhappy relationships are more likely to have sex less than once a week; but among happy couples, more sex won\u2019t make you happier. And if you\u2019re having sex less often but you\u2019re totally fine with it, that\u2019s between you and your partner(s)\u2014it\u2019s none of anybody else\u2019s business.",

            "text": "Daniel L. Carlson is an assistant professor in the Department of Family and Consumer Studies at the University of Utah and a senior research associate with the Council of Contemporary Families. Amanda Jayne Miller is an associate professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of Indianapolis. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.\n\n(CNN) Of all the things contemporary adults believe are vital for a good marriage, a satisfying sex life and fidelity are often the top two. So it's no wonder that a recent study that reports that American couples in the early 2010s have sex, on average, nine fewer times per year than couples in the 1990s did has set off alarm bells . The decline occurred only among cohabiting or married individuals rather than their single or dating counterparts.\n\nThis finding unleashed a wave of dire predictions about the future of happy marriages and a cascade of questions about how partners can make sure they are having enough sex. After all, according to Michele Weiner-Davis, author of \"The Sex-Starved Marriage,\" infrequent sex threatens intimacy and ultimately the relationship itself. \"Couples stop sitting next to each other on the couch. They stop laughing at each other's jokes. They don't spend time together. They stop being friends.\" she said in a 2014 talk at TEDxCU. To save marriages, Weiner-Davis urges the partner with the least interest in sex to adopt the Nike philosophy and \"Just Do It.\"\n\nWe beg to differ. Here's what we've learned: the less couples worry about how frequently they have sex, the more they may be able to improve the factors that predict the greatest sexual satisfaction and highest quality relationships: communication, perceived fairness, and a sense of teamwork in the daily working of the household.\n\nDon't get us wrong: We're big fans of happy, active, intimate, sexual relationships. But a lot of the worry about sexual frequency reflects some serious misconceptions about what researchers know and persistent myths about couples' sex lives.\n\nMyth #1: Sex is on the decline for all couples (hint: share the chores and you might share a lot more)\n\nThe first misconception about couples' sex lives is that the average decline represents the experience of all couples. But in a study we conducted with our colleagues Sharon Sassler and Sarah Hanson, we discovered one important exception: among the 1,780 low- to moderate-income couples in our samples who were married or cohabiting between 1992 and 2006, parents who share housework are, on average, having sex more frequently than a quarter of a century ago. Egalitarian couples also report higher levels of sexual and marital satisfaction than couples who divide the work less equally.\n\nGranted, only 30% of the couples we studied had adopted such egalitarian arrangements as of 2006. But that's a big increase compared to the past. Encouraging more such sharing might do more to increase sexual frequency and marital happiness than pointing couples to all those websites and magazine articles promising other ways to make your partner pant with desire.\n\nMyth #2: Couples are having less sex because they are working too hard\n\nMany people believe couples are too tired for sex because they are working too much. In fact, busy couples generally have more sex, not less. Looking at data from the late 1980s and early 1990s, researchers found that the busiest husbands and wives -- those who spent more time on housework and paid work -- reported having the most sex. We find something similar in our more contemporary data. Increases in the total time couples devote to unpaid housework results in significant increases in sexual frequency. While it is not entirely clear why more work equals more sex, it's possible that \"work hard/play hard\" couples carry the intensity and energy with which they pursue work into their time in the bedroom.\n\nMyth #3: Couples need to have lots of sex in order to be happy together\n\nIt is true that, on average, couples who have sex at least once a week report themselves happiest in their relationships. But having sex more than once a week yields no comparable increase in relationship satisfaction. We have found that the association between sexual satisfaction and relationship satisfaction is three times stronger than the association between sexual frequency and relationship satisfaction. In short, more often doesn't mean better.\n\nWhen it comes to couples' sex lives, quality trumps quantity, and sexual frequency is a poor predictor of sexual satisfaction. What matters is not how often couples engage in sex but how satisfied they are with their sexual encounters when they do have them.\n\nMyth #4: More sex means couples are happy with their sex lives\n\nThe weak link between sexual quality and quantity highlights something very important. Just because a couple is sexually active doesn't mean the sex is satisfying. Indeed, a simple count of sexual frequency tells us little about how often couples prefer to have sex or if the sex is good for both partners.\n\nAlthough sex is a way of demonstrating love and affection, it can also be a way of expressing traditional heterosexual notions of masculine domination and feminine compliance, with men deciding when, what, and how sexual acts are performed and the woman expected to satisfy what marriage counselors long considered to be his greater physical need.\n\nAdherence to gender conventions may create frequent but unsatisfying sex when it makes husbands feel compelled to push for sex and wives to perform it as a \"duty\" -- just one more chore to be added to an ever-growing list. Historian Stephanie Coontz has conducted interviews with women who married in the 1950s and early 1960s, and she told us in an e-mail that many reported being told by premarital counselors that it was unfair to deny their husbands \"relief\" just because they were \"not in the mood,\" and that a \"normal\" woman could always attain a vaginal orgasm. As one woman described the messages she received, \"you should never show any sexual desire before marriage or lack of desire afterwards.\"\n\nEven today, we found in research conducted with Brian Soller at the University of New Mexico, that although conventional gender attitudes lead to more sex by increasing male sexual control, they also negatively affect men's and women's abilities to take physical and psychological pleasure from sexual experiences. The same egalitarian attitudes that lead to shared housework may also deepen partner communication, which in turn leads to a greater sense of sexual intimacy.\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWith all these myths out there, what should we do about them?\n\nWe need to close the self-help books urging us to \"just do it;\" sexual frequency isn't the magic elixir that will save marriages..",

While some advocate the criminalisation of clients, sex worker-led organisations disagree; they say banning the purchasing of sex places sex workers in even more danger. Instead, they are calling for the decriminalisation of sex work \u2013 an approach which has been in place in New Zealand since 2003.\n\nMyths abound regarding New Zealand\u2019s model, including unsubstantiated claims that the sex industry has expanded, with pimps emboldened in the wake of the new law, and that sex trafficking is rife. So what do we really know about New Zealand\u2019s policy of decriminalisation?\n\nThe passing of the Prostitution Reform Act followed years of work by New Zealand\u2019s sex-worker organisation, the New Zealand Prostitutes Collective. Its purpose was to minimise harm, and so the law change not only removed legislation that criminalised sex work, but also afforded new rights to sex workers.\n\nDecriminalisation in New Zealand differs from legalised regimes, such as that in Germany, since it focuses on empowering sex workers themselves, rather than the state, to have greater control over their work.\n\nIn pictures: Sex workers protest in Paris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8 show all In pictures: Sex workers protest in Paris\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/8 A protester (R) holds a sign reading 'Prostitutes with fists raised against the penalisation of clients!' during a demonstration by sex workers and supporters near the French National Assembly in Paris\n\n2/8 A protester wears a hat rimmed with red roses during a demonstration by sex workers and supporters near the French National Assembly in Paris\n\n3/8 Sex workers hold signs during a protest against new bill against prostitution and sex trafficking\n\n4/8 Transgender sex workers protest against a parliamentary vote to enforce the penalisation of solicitation, near the Assemblee Nationale (French parliament) in Paris\n\n5/8 A protester wears a mask during a demonstration by sex workers and supporters near the French National Assembly in Paris\n\n6/8 Protesters wear masks during a demonstration by sex workers and supporters near the French National Assembly in Paris, as French lawmakers take part in a final debate on a bill that would make it illegal to pay for sex. French lawmakers were poised on April 6 to pass a controversial law that makes it illegal to pay for sex and imposes fines of up to 3,500 euros ($3,970) on prostitutes' clients\n\n7/8 Protesters hold up their fists and chant slogans during a demonstration by sex workers and supporters near the French National Assembly in Paris\n\n8/8 Protesters hold a banner reading 'Don't liberate me, I'll take care of it myself!'\n\nThis approach recognises that sex workers are the best people to advise on their own working conditions, but to allow them to do this there must be a transparent environment in which sex workers can report their experiences without putting themselves or their clients at risk of facing a criminal record.\n\nA requirement of the law change was that research would be undertaken in the years that followed to evaluate its effect. This study, completed by researchers from the University of Otago\u2019s School of Medicine, highlighted many benefits: more than 60 per cent of the 772 sex workers who participated reported feeling more able to refuse to see certain clients, and 95 per cent said they felt they had rights after decriminalisation.\n\nThese rights mean the balance of power has shifted: sex workers can more easily hold to account those who seek to exploit them.\n\nThis is well-illustrated by a 2014 case in which a sex worker pursued a brothel operator who had sexually harassed her through the Human Rights Tribunal. She won the case and was awarded $25,000 (\u00a313,777) in compensation.\n\nDecriminalisation \u2013 of both the sale and purchase of sex \u2013 is incredibly important for enabling access to justice when crimes are perpetrated against sex workers. A study conducted with street-based sex workers indicated a significant positive change in relationships between police and sex workers after the law changed. It showed how decriminalisation supports sex worker\u2019s safety strategies, enabling street workers to take their time in initial conversations with clients, without risking their clients being arrested and losing income as a result. It also means that clients can provide information to police when sex workers are assaulted. A woman I interviewed in 2009 was assisted by a client to contact police after she was attacked by a passerby.\n\nDatabase of information about violent crimes to sex workers \u2013 London Live\n\nAs for trafficking, while there is evidence of trafficking into other industries such as fruit picking, there is neither evidence that trafficking into sex work is a problem in New Zealand, nor is there evidence that the size of the sex industry has increased since decriminalisation. In fact, research suggests that decriminalisation has had little impact on the sex worker population at all, apart to provide it with protection.\n\nTo make policy that truly benefits sex workers we must separate myths from facts. Despite the oft-repeated claims of its shortcomings, the academic evidence that has been gathered so far clearly supports the New Zealand decriminalisation model as an ideal starting point.\n\nNo law is perfect, but this is the best approach we have so far for supporting sex worker rights and facilitating access to justice. There is no alternative worth pursuing.\n\nDr Lynzi Armstrong is a lecturer in criminology at the Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand",

But what does it really mean to be open? And how does this conversation come about? Surely it's not as easy as pausing Netflix and asking, \"so, um, you want to see other people?\"\n\nOr is it?\n\nTo find out, VICE chatted with three long-term couples about why they chose non-monogamy, what rules\u2014if any\u2014are involved, and why it works for them.\n\nKasara, 24 and Chris, 23\n\nVICE: How long have you two been together?\n\nChris: We're coming up on three years in October.\n\nAnd what's your origin story as a couple?\n\nKasara: We actually met on Tinder. That first night, we had some drinks and then went back to his place. I wasn't expecting to hear from him after that, but then we just started hanging out a lot. We called what we had a \"fucklationship\" for a while because we weren't familiar with any terms like open or non-monogamous.\n\nChris: And I was basically just looking to relax and enjoy myself the year I met Kasara, because with my last girlfriend I hadn't been having much fun.\n\nKasara: I'd also just gotten out of a relationship when we met, and so I liked the idea of maintaining that casual element. Then, when Chris left for Australia the first time\u2014he goes back to visit family periodically\u2014I ended up meeting somebody else who I developed some feelings for. His name was Yanis, but I talked to Chris about it and he was like, yep, that's fine. And so that's how we went from being open to a more poly situation.\n\nChris: It was initially a little bit strange when she was dating Yanis because I was so far removed and missing her and everything, but I was also incredibly happy that she had found someone to make her as happy as I did. It really opened my eyes to how making other connections can benefit a relationship. I mean, I haven't made any emotional connections with other people yet, but there's been dates and \"almosts.\" It's not something I'm overly concerned about one way or the other. I'm fairly content with where I'm at and what I'm doing.\n\nSo what do your friends and family think about your relationship?\n\nKasara: When I was dating Yanis, I invited him home while Chris was in Australia. I was still living with my parents, though, and so my mom pulled me aside and was like, \"you and Chris are moving in together soon! How can you do this to him?!\" I told her it was fine and a situation we'd agreed on. So I think my parents know, but it's never talked about.\n\nChris: One of my worst experiences was when we first decided to define ourselves as polyamorous. I was in this obnoxious phase where I wanted to tell as many people as I could about it, and so I brought it up with my volleyball team and they mocked me mercilessly for it. They said things like, \"She's going to go and fuck other guys, and you're okay with that? You're not going to get anything out of this.\" I tried to explain that's not quite how it works, but they never really accepted it. To them, it was just like this weird funny thing I was doing.\n\nKasara: Yeah, so when I tell guys about my relationship, watching their faces as they come to terms with it is hilarious. They make this thinking face and then they're like \"ooohh so you and your boyfriend aren't having sex\" and I'm like, \"No, we still do that.\" And then there's a pause, and he'll say, \"Ooohh so it's a convenience thing.\" And I'm like \"no!\" So that's always funny.\n\nSo why is poly the best choice for you both?\n\nKasara: It took a while for me to realize this, but I'm not a monogamous person. I've always been able to have feelings for other people. I don't think jealously should be perpetuated as the norm in relationships, as it is with monogamy.\n\nChris: I have a similar mindset. We never place limits on emotions other than love, like we don't say you can only be sad or happy about this one thing, but with monogamy it's like only one person is allowed to feel your love. And love is such a crazy emotion, so why not experience it with a bunch of people? Polyamory is OK, guys! We're not all weird.\n\n*Lyndsay, 24 and Tyler, 24\n\nVICE: When did the \"open relationship\" discussion take place for you, and why?\n\nLyndsay: I'd say it was about two years into our relationship, and we've been together for five. He opened it up and told me that if I wanted to go sleep with another guy, then I could. Because he gets so much enjoyment from my body\u2014my boobs are huge\u2014but he can't perform in the same way as someone with a bigger penis.\n\nTyler: Yeah. We were hitting a few bumpy spots on our relationship because she wasn't sexually satisfied. I have a micropenis, there's not much to work with, and so I felt I couldn't give Lyndsay the type of pleasure she was capable of feeling. And I just want the very best for her, so we started talking about different things we might do.\n\nLyndsay: First we talked about using toys to enhance my pleasure, but really, a cold plastic penis is not the same as a real one! And then we found that the realistic-feeling ones were, you know, about eight inches and I just couldn't handle that. Going from a micropenis to a giant fake one was never going to work.\n\nTyler: I figured that nothing was going to be better for her than the real thing. She deserves to get the same type of pleasure that I do from her. Why not let her have the best?\n\nThat seems really generous. But is there an element of self-sacrifice here? Does having a one-sided open relationship create any imbalance?\n\nLyndsay: There's always bit of fear and guilt for me around even thinking about sleeping with someone else, even though it's something Tyler actually wants. Like he wants me to have that pleasure. I still haven't actually been with anyone else though.\n\nOh, so it's more of a fantasy at this point? You're open to being open.\n\nLyndsay: Yeah. Because the thing is that I don't want to go and sleep with someone else and then have a bunch of shame about it. Right now we're more interested in the idea. We create scenarios and play with the idea.\n\nAnd how important is it that you 'consummate' this fantasy?\n\nTyler: To me, as long as she's happy, I don't really care whether it happens or not. I really think that she would enjoy it if she did try it. I have high hopes that she'd go through with it.\n\nDo you think you have a kink? Cuckold fantasies come to mind...\n\nTyler: I've thought about it that way. For me, I think it started when I was around 16. I had a friend with benefits who was kind of fascinated by my small penis, because she hadn't seen anyone who had one like mine. She would have sex with other guys, but she always came back to me. We wouldn't have actual sex, but she'd give me blow jobs and all that, like she just liked me and wanted to hang out. So maybe that sort of opened the door for me in terms of being OK with openness.\n\nLyndsay: I actually played a trick on him once, saying I was about to sleep with someone else. I was at the airport and I texted Tyler to say that I'd found a guy to do it with.\n\nTyler: And I was super excited for her, because I knew it'd be a new adventure. I think having those adventurous types of sexual experiences throughout your life can be fulfilling. I've had some in my own life and I want Lyndsay to have the opportunity too, but the thing is that I can't perform in a way that would allow that. So yeah, when she texted and said she was going to have sex in the airport bathroom, I was actually really happy.\n\nDo you feel jealousy or insecurity because of that?\n\nTyler: I'm really really comfortable with myself, so I was just excited. I'm accepted for the way I am. We still have a good sex life, regardless of my size.\n\nDaniel, 42 and Regina, 39\n\nVICE: How long have you two been together?\n\nRegina: We've been together for six-and-a-half years and married for four-and-a-half.\n\nFor what part of that time have you been open? And how did that decision get made?\n\nDaniel: Regina and I were together exclusively for a year before we started going to play parties with other couples. We're swingers.\n\nRegina: But right from the start, we discussed things like our sexual and relationship histories. He'd been married, I'd been married, and we'd both dated in the context of dating multiple people at the same time. In the age of Tinder and dating websites\u2014which is how we met\u2014you can date multiple people simultaneously and it's not necessarily that you're non-monogamous, but it's that your non-exclusive, and I feel like that's almost a precursor to eventually being non-monogamous.\n\nWhat initially drew you both to the swinging lifestyle?\n\nDaniel: About five years ago, my ex-wife told me she had fallen in love with another man. But she taught me the most profound lesson: no matter who you are, your partner could wake up one day and not be in love with you anymore. And that's no one's fault. I realized that my next relationship needed to be open because I no longer have the desire to control my partner. Control is just an illusion anyway.\n\nRegina: And for me, sex has never really been a big deal. I've never had any bad sexual experiences, fortunately. For me, meeting new people is exciting and not nerve-wracking or scary. So swinging feels right.\n\nIs there such a thing as infidelity in an open relationship?\n\nRegina: Yes. If you knowingly cross a boundary that you both set, that can be really hurtful.\n\nSo when you're out in the world or at a play party, what is your screening process normally like? Do you both have to agree on the person?\n\nRegina: Actually, I can give you an example from just the other night. So Daniel went to a bar and a girl asked him, \"what would you do to me, if you could?\" And he didn't know what to say! Then, he texted me and said \"she wants to know if I have your consent.\" This woman was literally asking my permission to have sex with my husband! And my response was \"only if you're really hot for her.\" So the next morning I got him on the phone and I told him I needed some aftercare. I said, \"I just want you to say, and honestly say, that you had a great last night but nothing compares to me.\" And he chuckled and said, \"Oh my god of course. I can't wait to get home to you.\" And that's the crux of it. After I hear him say that, and hear the tone in his voice, it's the most honest and tender thing ever. It's right.\n\nDaniel: Exactly. We're swinging because it's a great addition to our lives, not because we're missing anything with each other. All this feels like a big bonus. Swinging is just a nice fringe benefit.\n\n*Names have been changed.\n\nFollow Mica on Twitter.",

            "text": "When you look for web hosting services, there are many free options available. But there aren\u2019t that many places where you can host full stack web apps that involve APIs, CGI, or AJAX backend queries \u2014 especially if you want to use something other than PHP.\n\nThis article is a simple but meaningful \u201cwalk before you can run\u201d guide on how to get started with hosting your scripts on cloud servers.\n\nWhen to use a Cloud Application Platform\n\nCloud Application Platforms work well in scenarios where you need a bit of code to run on a server. Many of these platforms offer a series of Linux-based application containers (that appear like virtual machines) where you deploy the code you developed on your local computer with a set of command line keywords.\n\nHeroku is one such service you could use to host your code (in various languages) relatively easily. It offers a freemium model where they let you use about 500 hours of computing for free (their full pricing is here).\n\nAs of May 2017, the programming languages you can host under Heroku\n\nOnce you\u2019ve written your code on your local desktop, you can execute commands that deploy the code onto a workspace in Heroku. The code then executes depending on a trigger. Triggers can be a scheduled job, a web server which is triggered through a web page request, or something that is running constantly and processing data \u2014 which could get quite expensive.\n\nWhat\u2019s really nice is that you don\u2019t have to worry about the operating system (memory, storage, CPU, security patches) as that is all managed for you \u2014 but at the same time it means that you do have limited flexibility since you cannot allocate resources directly.\n\nSome specific examples where Heroku can work nicely for you:\n\nHosting your own website where you want to write your own web server\n\nPeriodically scraping data from a website and then storing it on a database for analysis\n\nOffering an API server for a specific task. Things like offering weather data, storing Internet of Things sensor data, or a web service call for a machine learning model\n\nA database service (although a service such as Firebase is possibly better suited)\n\nHeroku Architecture\n\nHeroku provides a lightweight virtual machine (VM) for you to deploy your code. Note that under the free option, you can deploy up to 5 applications that are considered as 5 lightweight VMs. For your actual application, you are provided a separate URL subdomain under Heroku. So your project names need to be unique.\n\nThese workspaces have their own space for components such as: code and resource files (not dynamic data files), database (Postgres), and log files.\n\nOn your local desktop, Heroku uses your directory name to define your project, and also for Heroku to understand your context. So you can have multiple projects in different directories and when you run the Heroku commands \u2014 just make sure you do so in the right folder.\n\nThe one key thing that you do need to be aware of (which I discovered the hard way through hours of debugging \u2014 I wish I paid more attention to the documentation) is that everything is run from memory. There is no persistent storage. I\u2019ll say it again \u2014 you cannot store any files on the file server! For persistence, Heroku offers a postgress SQL database where you can add records as required.\n\nA simple example \u2014 website change detection\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide to get a working example of a simple service that will email you if a website has changed \u2014 basically a clone of www.changedetection.com. There will be several key components of this:\n\nA database that will store: (a) the email address to notify of a changed website; (b) the website to track; (c) the last \u2018copy\u2019 of the website A piece of code that will check a given website from the database in #1 (Python script) A job scheduler that will run the program in #2 (equivalent of a cron job) A web user interface where you can add/delete websites to monitor into the database mentioned in #1 A mechanism to send out emails\n\nUnderstanding these components will arm you with the skills to do a lot of things already. I learned all of these things through multiple sources, so this acts as a consolidated post.\n\nAssumptions\n\nThe following guide makes the following assumptions:\n\nYou have a GitHub account \u2014 if you don\u2019t, please create one here. You should also read this simple guide.\n\nYou already have a Heroku account \u2014 if you don\u2019t please create one here.\n\nYou are running a Windows machine \u2014 if not, it is fine, the instructions are quite similar in other environments\n\nYou already have Python installed \u2014 if you don\u2019t, please go here to install it\n\nYou can already program in Python \u2014 if not, then I\u2019d suggest you learn some of the basics first. Some guides are here.\n\nYou know SQL \u2014 if you don\u2019t, please go here.\n\nOverview of the steps\n\nI find that going through a \u2018walk before you can run\u2019 approach helps with the learning process. It also serves as documentation for yourself for how to solve each piece of the larger process. That way, if something breaks in your future endeavor, you have a better chance of figuring out where it went wrong.\n\nStep 1 : Develop the web user interface \u2014 build Hello World first\n\nStep 2 : Persistence \u2014 create a database\n\nStep 3 : Check websites for changes\n\nStep 4: Send an email notification on changes\n\nStep 5 : List the output on the web page\n\nStep 6: Deploy\n\nStep 1: Develop the web user interface \u2014 build Hello World first\n\nFirst, let\u2019s get a simple program deployed onto Heroku to get things started. This program will be a precursor to the web user interface (item #4) in the components list above. In order to serve up a page, we could simply have an HTML page, but then we would need to have a web server to server that file. In other words, when you type in the URL of the website, a program would need to interpret the request, then provide the contents of the HTML file. You can create your own mini web server with the Flask Python library, which is what we\u2019ll do.\n\nCreate a folder called webchecker and go into that directory (this directory name does not have to be the same as the Heroku application name)\n\nInstall the Flask library. Enter the command: npm Flask\n\nCreate the following Python program and name it showchecks.py:\n\nimport os from flask import Flask , request app = Flask ( __name__ ) #create an instance of the Flask library @app.route ( '/hello' ) #whenever this webserver is called with <hostname:port>/hello then this section is called def hello (): #The subroutine name that handles the call output = 'Hello World' return output #Whatever is returned from this subroutine is what is returned to the requester and is shown on the browser page if __name__ == '__main__' : port = int ( os . environ . get ( 'PORT' , 5000 )) #The port to be listening to \u2014 hence, the URL must be <hostname>:<port>/ inorder to send the request to this program app . run ( host = '0.0.0.0' , port = port ) #Start listening\n\nBefore you deploy to Heroku, test that it works on your local PC. You can test it with the following steps:\n\nRun the program: python webchecker.com\n\nOpen up your browser on your local pc and open up the page: http://localhost:5000/hello\n\nRunning the script will return a static page with \u2018hello world\u2019 output\n\nNext, let\u2019s deploy this to Heroku. Before you can deploy, there needs to be a few more files that need to be included to help Heroku know more about your application.\n\nFirst, the requirements.txt\n\nFlask==0.12\n\nSecond, the file to tell Heroku what to run when a webrequest is made:\n\nweb : python showchecks . py\n\nFinally, the runtime version of Python to use (default is 2.7, but we want to specify the latest version of Python):\n\npython-3.6.1\n\nHence, you should have four files:\n\nshowchecker.py which is the code requirements.txt for the list of non-standard library dependencies. Whenever you have new libraries which are not part of the Python Standard Library \u2014 i.e. you need to install them using a tool such as \u201cpip\u201d \u2014 then add these here. You can find the version of an installed library such as Flask by running the command: pip show Flask in the command line Procfile which is the actual Python script to run when the website is called \u2014 make sure to update this if you change the Python file runtime.txt which is the actual version of python to use\n\nYou can deploy with the following steps from the command line:\n\nheroku create webchecker01 \u2014 buildpack heroku/python git add \\*.\\*\\* git status git commit -m \"all files\" git push heroku master\n\nOnce you run the \u201cgit push heroku master\u201d, the deployment logs will be shown including the url where it is deployed\n\nFor the command #1 (heroku create\u2026), the \u201cwebechecker01\u201d part is the unique name you\u2019ll need to provide for the name of the app.\n\nFor command #3 (git status) this will tell you what files are ready to be deployed. Make sure all files are there, if not add them using git add <filename>.\n\nNow you can check your website: <application name>.herokuapp.com/hello\n\nThe hello world program running on the web\n\nLet\u2019s also make sure we can see the logs since this is a great way to see what\u2019s going on with your app server. On your PC and in the webchecker directory, run the command: heroku logs\n\n\u201cheroku logs\u201d is a crucial command to run to see what\u2019s going on within your app server\n\nYou\u2019ll see the last execution steps. If things aren\u2019t working as expected, this is your first stop to find out more detail.\n\nYou can also go to the Heroku dashboard to see your consumption:\n\nhttps://dashboard.heroku.com\n\nStep 2: Persistence \u2014 create a database\n\nIn order to make more useful programs, you\u2019ll need to have a data store of sorts. This is where the Postgres database service comes into play. You first need to deploy the Heroku database service, then create your tables, and finally be able to connect to the database from your code locally (for testing).\n\nTo deploy a database service, first create it using the following command:\n\nheroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev\n\nNext, access the database from the command line and create your tables. The database is created on the Heroku cloud service and not locally. However, you can access it through the command line. To log on to the database via the console, run the command heroku pg:psql. Remember, you have to do it in your webchecker folder so that Heroku knows that it is the database for the webchecker site.\n\nTo see the list of tables type the command \\d\n\nTo create a table, you need to use normal SQL statements. For our webchecker program, let\u2019s create a table with the following columns:\n\nID \u2014 automatically generated ID for each entry (this will be the primary key). This is done by using the type \u201cserial\u201d\n\nwebsite \u2014 the website to monitor\n\nemailaddress \u2014 the email address to send the notification that a change has occurred\n\nlasthashcode \u2014 we won\u2019t store a copy of the whole webpage, instead we will generate a hash based on the HTML of the page, and then compare this each time. This is more efficient storage-wise, but will not tell us what actually changed\n\nlastchangedate \u2014 the date that the web changed last time. Hence we will get the database to default this with the current date\n\nTo create this table, enter the following command in the Heroku Postgres database console:\n\nCREATE TABLE webcheckerdb (id serial, website varchar(250), emailaddress varchar(250), lasthashcode varchar(32), lastchangedate timestamp DEFAULT current_date );\n\n(Make sure you include the semicolon at the end!)\n\nCreating the database, then using \\d switch to see the list of tables and then \u201c\\d webecheckerdb\u201d to see the columns\n\nNext, let\u2019s insert a single record in the database to ensure we have something to work with prior to getting our web UI up and running (you can use your own email address so it works in the future):\n\nINSERT into webcheckerdb values(DEFAULT, 'news.google.com', 'email@me.com', '', DEFAULT);\n\n(Make sure you include the semicolon at the end!)\n\nYou can then do a select statement (include the semicolon at the end!) to see the data\n\nYou can quit with \\q.\n\nStep 3 : Check websites for changes\n\nFirst, let\u2019s get a piece of code to at least check if a hardcoded site can be retrieved (following on the concept of walking before running).\n\nHence, first step is to see if we can retrieve a webpage, hash it, and then compare it to a hardcoded hash. Create a new Python file called checkwebsite.py. Code here:\n\nimport http.client import hashlib import pprint def getCurrentWebsiteHash ( weburl ): httpConn = http . client . HTTPSConnection ( weburl ) httpConn . request ( 'GET' , weburl ) resp = httpConn . getresponse () data = resp . read () hash_object = hashlib . md5 ( data ) print ( hash_object . hexdigest ()) return hash_object . hexdigest () def getWebList (): webRecordList = [ { 'website' : 'www.google.com' , 'lasthashcode' : 'xxx' } ] return webRecordList def checkWebList ( weblist ): for webrecord in weblist : pprint . pprint ( webrecord ) currWebHash = getCurrentWebsiteHash ( webrecord [ 'website' ]) if currWebHash != webrecord [ 'lasthashcode' ]: print ( 'Website ' + webrecord [ 'website' ] + ' has changed ' ) if __name__ == \"__main__\" : weblist = getWebList () checkWebList ( weblist )\n\nRunning this will output the following:\n\nIf you have any errors with missing libraries, you can add them via: pip install <library> from the command line.\n\nNext, let\u2019s connect to the database with the following code:\n\nimport http.client import hashlib import psycopg2 from psycopg2.extras import RealDictCursor import traceback import urllib.parse import pprint import os urllib . parse . uses_netloc . append ( \"postgres\" ) url = urllib . parse . urlparse ( os . environ [ \"DATABASE_URL\" ]) dbConn = psycopg2 . connect ( database = url . path [ 1 :], user = url . username , password = url . password , host = url . hostname , port = url . port ) dbCur = dbConn . cursor ( cursor_factory = RealDictCursor ) def getCurrentWebsiteHash ( weburl ): print ( \"getting url:\" + weburl ) httpConn = http . client . HTTPSConnection ( weburl ) #Create connection object httpConn . request ( 'GET' , weburl ) #Get the website resp = httpConn . getresponse () data = resp . read () #Get the webdata into a string object hash_object = hashlib . md5 ( data ) #Createa hash code print ( hash_object . hexdigest ()) #print hash code return hash_object . hexdigest () def getWebList (): rows = [] try : dbCur . execute ( \"select * from webcheckerdb\" ) #Get all records from database rows = dbCur . fetchall () except : print ( \"error during select: \" + str ( traceback . format_exc ()) ) return rows def checkWebList ( weblist ): for webrecord in weblist : #Loop through each record in database pprint . pprint ( webrecord ) currWebHash = getCurrentWebsiteHash ( webrecord [ 'website' ]) #Get the current websites latest hash code if currWebHash != webrecord [ 'lasthashcode' ]: print ( 'Website ' + webrecord [ 'website' ] + ' has changed ' ) try : #If there is a change, print out the change, but also update the database so that next time #the message wont get triggered again dbCur . execute ( \"update webcheckerdb set lasthashcode ='\" + str ( currWebHash ) + \"' where id = '\" + str ( webrecord [ 'id' ]) + \"'\" ) dbConn . commit () print ( 'Website hash updated for next time' ) except : print ( \"error during update: \" + str ( traceback . format_exc ()) ) if __name__ == \"__main__\" : weblist = getWebList () checkWebList ( weblist )\n\nWhen you try to run this code, you are likely going to get an error of the form KeyError: \u2018DATABASE_URL\u2019. This is because your Python code is trying to locate the web address of the Postgres database hosted on Heroku. This is automatically updated to the environment variable DATABASE_URL in the Heroku server. However, on your local PC you will have to do this manually:\n\nheroku config set DATABASE_URL=<the database string listed from \u201cheroku config\u201d>\n\nIf you get the DATABASE_URL error, then set the environment variable\n\nStep 4: Send an email notification on changes\n\nFinal step is to send an email. To do this, you\u2019ll need to install an Addon that has the ability to send emails \u2014 you can find these via the Heroku marketplace: https://elements.heroku.com/addons\n\nIn here, there is an Addon called SendGrid: https://elements.heroku.com/addons/sendgrid\n\nYou can add SendGrid to your app in the command line by typing:\n\nheroku addons:create sendgrid:starter\n\nWhen you go to your dashboard you can see the new Addon in the Resources section:\n\nSendGrid addon that can enable sending emails will be at the bottom\n\nBefore using it, you\u2019ll need to create an API key. Double click the SendGrid component above and go into Settings->API Key->Create Key (blue button on top right).\n\nClick on the Create Key button at top right\n\nOnce you create the key, copy it and go back to the command prompt and enter:\n\nheroku config:set SENDGRID_API_KEY=<API key from above>\n\nThis will only register it on the server, you need to add it locally to your desktop with:\n\nset SENDGRID_API_KEY=<API Key from above again>\n\nOnce done, you can test your code in a new Python script called sendmail.py. Install the library via pip install sendgrid:\n\nimport sendgrid import os from sendgrid.helpers.mail import * def sendemail ( recipient , emailSubject , body ): sg = sendgrid . SendGridAPIClient ( apikey = os . environ . get ( 'SENDGRID_API_KEY' )) from_email = Email ( \"heroku@myapp.com\" ) to_email = Email ( recipient ) content = Content ( \"text/plain\" , body ) mail = Mail ( from_email , emailSubject , to_email , content ) response = sg . client . mail . send . post ( request_body = mail . get ()) print ( \"### Email sent to: \" + recipient + \" ###\" ) print ( response . status_code ) print ( response . body ) print ( response . headers ) if __name__ == \"__main__\" : sendemail ( 'email@me.com' , \"hello world\" , \"you have mail!\" )\n\nTo confirm the email was sent and delivered, you can go back to the SendGrid dashboard and checking the Statistics Overview screen:\n\nWhen checking your email, remember to check your spam.\n\nOnce it is working, there are only two lines of code you need to add to your main checkwebsite.py script. It is:\n\nimport sendmail #import the send email subroutine you wrote above ... #call the subroutine after find the hashcode has changed sendmail . sendemail ( webrecord [ 'emailaddress' ], 'Website changed' , webrecord [ 'website' ] + ' changed' )\n\nThe full code is here:\n\nimport http.client import hashlib import psycopg2 from psycopg2.extras import RealDictCursor import traceback import urllib.parse import pprint import os import sendmail #import the send email subroutine urllib . parse . uses_netloc . append ( \"postgres\" ) url = urllib . parse . urlparse ( os . environ [ \"DATABASE_URL\" ]) dbConn = psycopg2 . connect ( database = url . path [ 1 :], user = url . username , password = url . password , host = url . hostname , port = url . port ) dbCur = dbConn . cursor ( cursor_factory = RealDictCursor ) def getCurrentWebsiteHash ( weburl ): print ( \"getting url:\" + weburl ) httpConn = http . client . HTTPSConnection ( weburl ) #Create connection object httpConn . request ( 'GET' , weburl ) #Get the website resp = httpConn . getresponse () data = resp . read () #Get the webdata into a string object hash_object = hashlib . md5 ( data ) #Createa hash code print ( hash_object . hexdigest ()) #print hash code return hash_object . hexdigest () def getWebList (): rows = [] try : dbCur . execute ( \"select * from webcheckerdb\" ) #Get all records from database rows = dbCur . fetchall () except : print ( \"error during select: \" + str ( traceback . format_exc ()) ) return rows def checkWebList ( weblist ): for webrecord in weblist : #Loop through each record in database pprint . pprint ( webrecord ) currWebHash = getCurrentWebsiteHash ( webrecord [ 'website' ]) #Get the current websites latest hash code if currWebHash != webrecord [ 'lasthashcode' ]: print ( 'Website ' + webrecord [ 'website' ] + ' has changed email to ' + webrecord [ 'emailaddress' ]) #call the subroutine after find the hashcode has changed sendmail . sendemail ( webrecord [ 'emailaddress' ], 'Website changed' , webrecord [ 'website' ] + ' changed' ) try : #If there is a change, print out the change, but also update the database so that next time #the message wont get triggered again dbCur . execute ( \"update webcheckerdb set lasthashcode ='\" + str ( currWebHash ) + \"' where id = '\" + str ( webrecord [ 'id' ]) + \"'\" ) dbConn . commit () print ( 'Website hash updated for next time' ) except : print ( \"error during update: \" + str ( traceback . format_exc ()) ) if __name__ == \"__main__\" : weblist = getWebList () checkWebList ( weblist )\n\nStep 5 : List the output on the web page and schedule the job\n\nThe next step is to list the output on the webpage.\n\nThis involves querying the database, and then cycling through and showing the data on your screen. Hence, it takes the \u2018Hello World\u2019 code above, and makes the modification. I also created a different path for this, so to test this out you\u2019ll need to go to the URL: http://localhost:5000/list\n\nimport os from flask import Flask , request import hashlib import psycopg2 from psycopg2.extras import RealDictCursor import traceback import urllib.parse import pprint app = Flask ( __name__ ) #create an instance of the Flask library urllib . parse . uses_netloc . append ( \"postgres\" ) url = urllib . parse . urlparse ( os . environ [ \"DATABASE_URL\" ]) dbConn = psycopg2 . connect ( database = url . path [ 1 :], user = url . username , password = url . password , host = url . hostname , port = url . port ) dbCur = dbConn . cursor ( cursor_factory = RealDictCursor ) @app.route ( '/list' ) #whenever this webserver is called with <hostname:port>/hello then this section is called def list (): #The subroutine name that handles the call output = 'Check status:' rows = [] try : dbCur . execute ( \"select * from webcheckerdb\" ) #Get all records from database rows = dbCur . fetchall () for webrecord in rows : #Loop through each record in database output = output + '<BR> ' + pprint . pformat ( webrecord ) except : output = \"error during select: \" + str ( traceback . format_exc ()) return output #Whatever is returned from this subroutine is what is returned to the requester and is shown on the browser page @app.route ( '/hello' ) #whenever this webserver is called with <hostname:port>/hello then this section is called def hello (): #The subroutine name that handles the call output = 'Hello World' return output #Whatever is returned from this subroutine is what is returned to the requester and is shown on the browser page if __name__ == '__main__' : port = int ( os . environ . get ( 'PORT' , 5000 )) #The port to be listening to \u2014 hence, the URL must be <hostname>:<port>/ inorder to send the request to this program app . run ( host = '0.0.0.0' , port = port ) #Start listening\n\nAnd here\u2019s the output:\n\nStep 6: Deploy\n\nThe final step is to deploy everything to Heroku and then schedule the job so that it checks email.\n\nYou should have the following files:\n\nProcfile \u2014 the file which points to showchecker.py requirements.txt \u2014 the file which contains the library dependencies runtime.txt \u2014 the version of python showchecker.py \u2014 the python code which shows the database output on the web via <your appname>.herokuapp.com/list checkwebsite.py \u2014 the python code that checks for any changes on the websites\n\nFor the requirements.txt, you will need to make amendments to add the latest libraries:\n\nFlask==0.12 psycopg2==2.6.2 sendgrid==3.6.3\n\nDeploy these all to Heroku:\n\ngit add \\*.\\*\\* git commit -m \"deployment\" git push heroku master\n\nTest each component:\n\nGo to <your app name>.herokuapp.com/hello Go to <your app name>.herokuapp.com/list\n\nIf there are any errors, then run heroku logs in the command line to see what is going on.\n\nNext, run the checkwebsite.py directly on Heroku to make sure there are no issues. To do this, you can type:\n\nheroku run python checkwebsite.py\n\nThis is a great way to ensure your code is running as well on the heroku cloud as locally\n\nFinally, you can now schedule your job. Again, you need to include an Addon to do this.\n\nheroku addons:create scheduler:standard\n\nAnd you should be able to see the scheduler in your resources page:\n\nThe scheduler addon has been included as well which you can double click\n\nYou can simply use the command line to run the program, in our case it is: python checkwebsite.py (this is the same as what we tested above with the heroku run command).\n\nYou can schedule this with a few options.\n\nSummary\n\nAnd that\u2019s it\u2026 the first time it is a little complex, but hopefully the above incremental steps will help you understand what\u2019s going on under the hood. There are a lot more resources on Heroku as well as a wealth of information on Stack Overflow. These resources should make a lot more sense after going through the above.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nThanks for reading!

You\u2019ll need to master a variety of skills, ranging from machine learning to business analytics.\n\nHowever, the rewards are worth it. Organizations will prize alchemists who can turn raw data into smarter decisions, better products, happier customers, and ultimately more profit. Plus, you\u2019ll get to solve interesting problems and master new, impactful technologies.\n\nIf that sounds like a career you\u2019d enjoy, then bookmark this page and read on because we compiled this list just for you.\n\nData Science Resources\n\nFoundational Skills Programming and Data Wrangling\n\nStatistics and Probability Technical Skills Data Collection\n\nSQL\n\nData Visualization\n\nApplied Machine Learning Business Skills Communication\n\nCreativity and Innovation\n\nOperations and Strategy\n\nBusiness Analytics Supplementary Skills Natural Language Processing\n\nRecommendation Systems\n\nTime Series Analysis Practice Projects\n\nCompetitions\n\nProblem Solving Challenges\n\nCertain roles might require other skills, such as:\n\nDeep Learning, Big Data, Optimization, Anomaly Detection, Graph and Network Models, Quantitative Finance, Research Leadership, Project Management, Product Design, Software Engineering, Spacial Data Analysis, etc...\n\nIn this guide, we'll only be covering the skills that are most frequently demanded across the industry.\n\n1. Foundational Skills\n\nFoundational skills form the basis of true understanding, which will in turn allow you to discover novel solutions, build more accurate models, and make better decisions.\n\n1.1. Programming and Data Wrangling\n\nFirst, you'll need to know at least one scripting language well enough to wrangle datasets, prototype models, and perform analyses.\n\nWe strongly recommend choosing between Python or R, as they are both open-source (free), widely adopted, and supported by active communities. They each have their own strengths, but we recommend picking just one at the start.\n\nPython is more common in software startups, large tech firms, and adTech. Python tends to be more flexible because it's a general purpose programming language. It's also better for deep learning and processing data.\n\nis more common in software startups, large tech firms, and adTech. Python tends to be more flexible because it's a general purpose programming language. It's also better for deep learning and processing data. R / RStudio is popular in research, finance, and analytics. R is a statistical programming language that has mature libraries for econometrics, statistics, and machine learning.\n\nis popular in research, finance, and analytics. R is a statistical programming language that has mature libraries for econometrics, statistics, and machine learning. We've also written a more detailed comparison of Python vs. R for data science.\n\nIf you're still on the fence, we'd recommend starting with Python due to its breadth and flexibility (and it's a bit more beginner-friendly).\n\nTip: Each resource link below opens in a new tab, so you won't lose your place.\n\nPython Resources:\n\nR / RStudio Resources:\n\nR for Data Science (Online Book) - Recommended for beginners who want a complete course in data science with R.\n\nSwirl (Interactive R Package) - Very cool R package that you can install and learn the language directly from inside RStudio (the most common interface used to run R).\n\nIntroduction to Data Science with R (Video Series) - For those who learn better by watching someone else walk through the steps.\n\n1.2. Statistics and Probability\n\nA strong statistics foundation helps you fully understand machine learning, conditional probability, A/B testing, and many other core skills. It also helps you \"think like a data scientist,\" which include spotting biases, efficiently iterating on predictive models, and knowing how to extract insights from data.\n\nPlus, learning the common probability distributions (especially Gaussian, Binomial, Uniform, Exponential, Poisson) is critical for implementing many real-world applications, such as multi-armed bandits, market-basket analyses, and anomaly detection programs.\n\n2. Technical Skills\n\nData science is all about converting raw data into insights, predictions, software, and so on. Therefore, you'll need to be comfortable working with data.\n\nCore technical skills include collecting, cleaning, managing, and visualizing data, plus the big umbrella of applied machine learning.\n\n2.1. Data Collection\n\nEverything hinges on the quality and quantity of your data. Just as a chemist needs the right chemicals, you'll need relevant data.\n\nThere are 4 common ways to collect data:\n\nInternal Data. This is proprietary data that your company collects through its operations or through partnerships with other providers. This is usually the most relevant data. Searching Online. Need a labeled set of 8 million videos? There's a webpage for that... Seriously, you'd be surprised at what you can find out there. Online datasets allow you to prototype before investing in proprietary data. API's. API's allow you to programmatically (and legally) access datasets that other companies collect. You can find anything from Twitter feeds to weather data to financial data. Web Scraping. Web crawling and scraping is a powerful tool that you must use responsibly. It opens a whole new world, but make sure to respect terms of services.\n\nAPI Resources:\n\nPython: requests Quickstart Guide (Tutorial) - How to use the requests library to request data from API's.\n\nR: httr Quickstart Guide (Tutorial) - How to use the httr library to request data from API's.\n\nWeb Scraping Resources:\n\nR: rvest (Tutorial) - Basic web scraping with the rvest library.\n\nPython Web Scraping Libraries - Our overview of the Python web scraping landscape.\n\n2.2. SQL\n\nSQL is the lingua franca for database management and querying, and you should be able to write complex queries.\n\nLearning SQL also gives a better understanding of relational data in general (i.e. data in \"table\" format), which will improve your data analysis skills in any language.\n\nIntro to SQL by Khan Academy (Course) - Comprehensive video series that covers every important SQL topic.\n\nsqlcourse.com (Interactive Tutorial) - Great to use review or a quick crash course.\n\nSQL Fundamentals (Course) - Course that covers the basics of SQL. Includes quizzes along the way to test your understanding.\n\n2.3. Data Visualization\n\nData visualization is important for exploratory analysis and for communicating your insights, and no list of data science resources would be complete without this topic.\n\nRaw data can be difficult to interpret, so you'll need to investigate trends and distributions with plots and charts.\n\n2.4. Applied Machine Learning\n\nMachine learning is a broad umbrella term that contains many sub-tasks. In a nutshell, it's about teaching computers how to learn patterns and models from data.\n\nTo some people, machine learning is synonymous with data science, but we consider it a separate field that heavily overlaps with data science. There's no doubt that machine learning is a powerful toolset, and it's the meatiest skill on this list.\n\n3. Business Skills\n\nBusiness skills and soft skills are sometimes overlooked in data science curricula, but they are supremely important, and employers will look out for them.\n\nData science is never performed in a vacuum. You'll need to anticipate business needs, think creatively about solutions, and communicate your insights clearly.\n\nAs machine learning libraries mature and algorithms become easier to use \"out-of-the-box,\" businesses will value people who can work with data and work with people. This section of our list of data science resources will help you stand out.\n\n3.1. Communication\n\nIf a tree falls in a forest but no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? If data is analyzed but no one can explain the results, does it really matter?\n\nEffective communication skills are universal, but data scientists have the added challenge of discussing highly technical or mathematical topics.\n\nDuring data scientist interviews, you'll often be asked to \"explain a technical concept to a layperson\" or \"describe a previous project you've worked on.\" Employers will specifically look for clarity, conciseness, and organization.\n\nThe best stats you've ever seen (TED Talk) - This is an iconic TED talk and a fun display of storytelling with data.\n\nThink Fast, Talk Smart (Video) - This is a workshop at the Stanford Graduate School of Business on how to overcome anxiety and speak spontaneously. Not only will this help you for the rest of your career, but it will also allow you to stand out during your interview.\n\n7 Tips for Improving Communication (Video) - Simple, practical tips on how to communicate effectively on a daily basis.\n\nHow to Win Friends and Influence People (PDF), (Free Audiobook Version) - This is a book we'd recommend for anyone, data scientist or not. While some of the verbiage is a bit dated, the teachings about interpersonal relationships are timeless.\n\nPractice teaching a technical concept to a friend - This will help you solidify your understanding of the concept while getting valuable communication practice. Try explaining an interesting machine learning algorithm, including its strengths, weaknesses, and proper use cases.\n\n- This will help you solidify your understanding of the concept while getting valuable communication practice. Try explaining an interesting machine learning algorithm, including its strengths, weaknesses, and proper use cases. Practice describing projects that you've completed - This will help you practice organizing the many moving parts of data science into coherent narratives.\n\n3.2. Creativity & Innovation\n\nData scientists are hired to build new products, perform complex analyses, and invent valuable ways to use data.\n\nIn fact, they rarely solve the same problem twice. Even if you can apply the same methods to an adjacent dataset, you'll need to be creative about feature engineering, supplemental data, and business implications.\n\nYou'll naturally become a better creative thinker as you gain more experience, but the following resources can help jumpstart your problem-solving and innovation skills.\n\n3.3. Business Operations and Strategy\n\nHere's a question you should ask yourself every day: \"What are some ways I can improve this business?\"\n\nAt the end of the day, companies don't hire you to analyze data... they hire you to help them grow or become more profitable. This means that you should have an understand how data can help make better decisions and build better products.\n\n3.4. Business Analytics\n\nBusiness analytic skills are critical for data scientists in operational roles. Python and R will allow you to perform more complex analyses than Excel can, thanks to the flexibility of programming languages.\n\nAfter you master the technical tools, building strong domain knowledge will lead to greater business impact.\n\n4. Supplementary Skills\n\nSupplementary Skills are more situational depending on the role, but they help you become a well-rounded data scientist. Here are data science resources for NLP, recommender systems, and time series analysis.\n\n4.2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP), or Text Mining, is an exciting sub-field of machine learning for extracting structure, grammar, and insights from text.\n\nFamous applications include Sentiment Analysis, Article Classification, and even teaching a Neural Network to write Shakespeare.\n\n4.3. Recommendation Systems\n\nRecommendation Systems, or Collaborative Filters, are one of the great success stories of data science, especially in e-Commerce.\n\nThey power many amazing websites and apps, including Amazon, Yelp, Netflix, and Spotify. In a nutshell, recommendation systems find other users who have similar tastes to you to make better recommendations for you. This produces a huge win-win by improving user experience while driving up revenue.\n\nRecommendation engine tutorial (Video Series) - Introduction to collaborative filters using Python. Does a very nice job of explaining the intuition behind the algorithm.\n\nRecommender Systems (Video Series) - Discussion of the theory and math behind collaborative filters by Andrew Ng. More math-heavy, and it'll be easier to follow if you have some background with Linear Algebra.\n\nCollaborative Filtering with Python (Tutorial) - Reference tutorial that implements a music recommender system in Python.\n\nCollaborative Filtering with R (Tutorial) - The same tutorial as the previous one, except in R.\n\n4.3. Time Series Analysis\n\nTime Series Analysis deals with data series that are indexed by time. For example, stock prices, precipitation amounts, and Twitter hashtags by hour would all be considered time series. Time series analysis is commonly used in Finance, Forecasting, and Econometrics.\n\nWhile much of machine learning deals with \"cross-sectional data\" (data without regard to differences in time), there are also models specifically designed to handle time series.\n\n5. Practice\n\nPractice projects have two main purposes:\n\nThey help you solidify concepts and practice pulling together all the moving pieces of data science. They arm you with something tangible to show employers. If a picture is worth 1000 words, a project is worth a million...\n\nBy nature, projects are personal undertakings, and you should pick topics you're interested in. Here are a few places to find project ideas:\n\n6 Fun Machine Learning Projects for Beginners - Our list of 6 fun machine learning project ideas for beginners.\n\n- Our list of 6 fun machine learning project ideas for beginners.

            "text": "This winter I went to Utah with some friends, and explored some of the most remote and beautiful places in the world. I hiked through Star Wars looking terrains, and was in awe at the bright red canyons. However, there was one problem: we were in such remote places, the cellular connection was usually 2G at best.\n\n2G is just enough to send a text message, but it cannot load The Weather Channel. This was very annoying, as we were often not prepared for rainy or cold weather hikes. This does not only happen in remote places either. In my school\u2019s gym locker room, the connection is usually nonexistent. It makes getting important pre-running-practice data, such as the windchill, hard to get. This got me thinking about making my own SMS bot that would get me the information that I needed without the need for a strong 3G or LTE connection.\n\nBuild the Bot\n\nI built the SMS bot using the Twilio API and Python, which allows you to send a Twilio number messages and get answers back. Though this project may seem daunting at first, do not worry! You will learn how to use command prompt/terminal, how to set up and host a server, and how to manipulate strings and then query data from different APIs.\n\nTwilio makes it really easy to install everything you need, Using Python and tools such as PIP (a Python package manager), you can easily get ready to start creating your own SMS server in no time. Just follow these steps to get your development environment setup, and do not be daunted by the complicated looking commands. You do not need to understand exactly what everything does. Just know that if you follow these steps correctly, everything you will need will be installed.\n\nStep 1\n\nFirst, because we are going to be using Python for this project, you will need to have Python installed. To check if you have Python installed already, open up command prompt or terminal and type in:\n\npython --version\n\nYou should get a response that says something like \u201c python -2.7.0 \u201d The version number doesn\u2019t matter. If you don\u2019t have Python installed, go install it. There are countless resources online to install the compiler.\n\nStep 2\n\nNow that you have Python installed, you need to install PIP, a Python package manager. PIP will allow you to easily install a myriad of libraries, including Twilio. Instead of searching up online how to install every single SDK you want to use, with PIP you can just type \u201cpip [package name]\u201d into terminal. Chances are if you are a Python developer you already have this installed. If not, no worries.\n\nWe also have to install something called Virtual Environment (virtualenv), which allows us to run a program that will run the specific versions of tools we need. It also conveniently includes PIP, which is great! Think of it as a tool that separates your program into a separate sandbox, and if you play around with PIP and update different packages your code will still run correctly. Sometimes with coding, you\u2019ll do random things that you don\u2019t completely understand. Virtualenv makes sure this doesn\u2019t break your program.\n\nTo install, first move to the folder where you will store your program and type in one of these commands until you see it install (these are meant for different Python versions):\n\neasy_install virtualenv\n\nor\n\neasy_install-2.7 virtualenv\n\nor\n\npip install virtualenv\n\nIf at any time you get a \u201cpermission denied\u201d text, type in \u201csudo\u201d before the command and enter your laptop password. Now run your virtualenv to start installing tools specific to our project into this \u201csandbox.\u201d It should say your folder name in parentheses in the beginning of the terminal line when activated by this command:\n\nsource bin/activate\n\nStep 3\n\nNow that we have installed the more widely used Python development tools PIP and virtualenv, we have to install the libraries that are specific to our SMS project: Twilio and Flask. The Twilio library allows for you to send and receive messages, and Flask allows your Python program to connect to a local server.\n\nWe are going to install specific versions of each into our sandbox (note that virtualenv is still running from the step before), ensuring our program will always run correctly. To install them all at once, open up a random text file and rename it to requirements.txt. To ensure the correct versions of each are installed, in the txt file type:\n\nFlask>=0.8 twilio>=3.3.6\n\nInstall it to your computer by typing \u201cbin/pip install -r requirements.txt\u201d into terminal.\n\nStep 4\n\nWe have one final program to install, Ngrok (download it from their website). When running, Ngrok will connect our local host running program (our program will run locally through Flask) to the world wide web, and will provide us with an http address. Twilio will use this address to send us incoming messages.\n\nStep 5\n\nNow that we have all the programs we need, we can start setting up our bot. Go to Twilio\u2019s website and press \u201cGet a Free API Key.\u201d Create an account (select the free account option) and go to the dashboard.\n\nStep 6\n\nNow that we have everything set up we can start coding. Open up your favorite text editor, save the file as \u201crun.py\u201d (or whatever name you wish) and type the following (I have commented next to the code to explain each line):\n\n# import all the libraries we will be using from flask import Flask, request from twilio import twiml # set up Flask to connect this code to the local host, which will # later be connected to the internet through Ngrok app = Flask(__name__) # Main method. When a POST request is sent to our local host through Ngrok # (which creates a tunnel to the web), this code will run. The Twilio service # sends the POST request - we will set this up on the Twilio website. So when # a message is sent over SMS to our Twilio number, this code will run @app.route('/', methods=['POST']) def sms(): # Get the text in the message sent message_body = request.form['Body'] # Create a Twilio response object to be able to send a reply back (as per # Twilio docs) resp = twiml.Response() # Send the message body to the getReply message, where # we will query the String and formulate a response replyText = getReply(message_body) # Text back our response! resp.message('Hi\n\n\n\n' + replyText ) return str(resp) # when you run the code through terminal, this will allow Flask to work if __name__ == '__main__': app.run()\n\nStep 7\n\nNow we need to create a getReply method. This method will simply look through our text message body and figure out the type of information we want. It will then get the information from different APIs and return a response. Assuming our text message will be formatted as \u201ckeyword_request,\u201d a simple format that we can use to identify what is requested in the message is as follows:\n\n# Function to formulate a response based on message input. def getReply(message): # Make the message lower case and without spaces on the end for easier handling message = message.lower().strip() # This is the variable where we will store our response answer = \"\" if \"weather\" in message: answer = \u201cget the weather using a weather API\u201d # is the keyword \"wolfram\" in the message? Ex: \"wolfram integral of x + 1\" elif \"wolfram\" in message: answer = \u201cget a response from the Wolfram Alpha API\u201d # is the keyword \"wiki\" in the message? Ex: \"wiki donald trump\" elif \"wiki\" in message: answer = \u201cget a response from the Wikipedia API\u201d # is the keyword \u201csome_keyword\u201d in the message? You can create your own custom # requests! Ex: \u201cschedule Monday\u201d elif \u201csome_keyword\u201d in message: answer = \u201csome response\u201d # the message contains no keyword. Display a help prompt to identify possible # commands else: answer = \"\n\nWelcome! These are the commands you may use:\n\nWOLFRAM \\\"wolframalpha request\\\"\n\nWIKI \\\"wikipedia request\\\"\n\nWEATHER \\\"place\\\"\n\nSOME_KEYWORD \\\"some custom request\\\"\n\n\" # Twilio can not send messages over 1600 characters in one message. Wikipedia # summaries may have way more than this. # So shortening is required (1500 chars is a good bet): if len(answer) > 1500: answer = answer[0:1500] + \"...\" # return the formulated answer return answer\n\nStep 8\n\nNow our message format is as follows: \u201cKeyword_request\u201d. However, you cannot put in \u201cwolfram calories in bread\u201d into wolfram alpha. However, you can put in \u201ccalories in bread\u201d. So now we have to take out \u201cwolfram\u201d from the message to isolate the request. We can do so with the following method:\n\n# Function for editing input text. Ex: If you send the message \"wolfram calories in bread\", # the program will recognize \"wolfram\" and call this function and will # change the text to \"calories in bread\", which will then be sent to wolfram. def removeHead(fromThis, removeThis): if fromThis.endswith(removeThis): fromThis = fromThis[:-len(removeThis)].strip() elif fromThis.startswith(removeThis): fromThis = fromThis[len(removeThis):].strip() return fromThis\n\nStep 9\n\nIt\u2019s time to put in the APIs. We will be using Wolfram Alpha, Wikipedia, and yWeather. All have amazing documentation online, so I won\u2019t be going much into how to formulate each \u201cif statement\u201d in the getReply method. For Wolfram Alpha you will need to go to their API site to get an API key. Wikipedia and yWeather do not require keys.\n\nStep 10\n\nLet\u2019s set up the Wikipedia API. Go to terminal and type in \u201cpip install wikipedia\u201d . Now go to the Wikipedia if statement in the getReply method and add the following:\n\n# is the keyword \"wiki\" in the message? Ex: \"wiki donald trump\" elif \"wiki\" in message: # remove the keyword \"wiki\" from the message message = removeHead(message, \"wiki\") # Get the wikipedia summary for the request Try: # Get the summary off wikipedia answer = wikipedia.summary(message) except: # handle errors or non specificity errors (ex: there are many people # named donald) answer = \"Request was not found using wiki. Be more specific?\"\n\nYep, it\u2019s that easy.\n\nStep 11\n\nLet\u2019s test out our code so far with Wikipedia. Go to terminal, locate your Python file, make sure your virtual environment is running (enter \u201c source bin/activate \u201d), and then run your program by typing \u201c python run.py \u201d. You should see a message that Flask is running on some sort of number. Keep the port number in mind. My terminal screen is shown below, and the port number is 5000 in my case:\n\nNow open another terminal window and enter the following command: \u201c ngrok http [port number] \u201d. You should see the screen turn black:\n\nCopy either one of the forwarding http addresses. Now go to your Twilio dashboard and press the \u201c#\u201d on the left. Click on your Twilio number, scroll down and enter the http address into the space that says \u201cA message comes in\u201d. Make sure the dropdown is set to \u201cwebhook\u201d:\n\nClick save. You are ready to go!\n\nStep 12\n\nText your twilio number, and see if you get a response!\n\nConclusion\n\nYou have now created your own SMS bot. You can keep your program running for as long as you like, and can restart it by following Step 11. Now that you have the outline of how the code should be written, feel free to add whatever requests you want!\n\nFor example, I added a way to get my schedule for the corresponding day. So if I text my Twilio number, \u201cA day schedule\u201d, it will return my class schedule. Be as creative as you wish, and add as many APIs as you want. Just read their docs on how to use them and you should be fine. Happy coding!",

            "text": "How to host lightweight apps for free\n\nHeroku is one such service you could use to host your code (in various languages) relatively easily. It offers a freemium model where they let you use about 500 hours of computing for free (their full pricing is here ).\n\nCloud Application Platforms work well in scenarios where you need a bit of code to run on a server. Many of these platforms offer a series of Linux-based application containers (that appear like virtual machines) where you deploy the code you developed on your local computer with a set of command line keywords.\n\nThis article is a simple but meaningful \u201cwalk before you can run\u201d guide on how to get started with hosting your scripts on cloud servers.\n\nWhen you look for web hosting services, there are many free options available. But there aren\u2019t that many places where you can host full stack web apps that involve APIs, CGI, or AJAX backend queries \u2014 especially if you want to use something other than PHP.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve written your code on your local desktop, you can execute commands that deploy the code onto a workspace in Heroku. The code then executes depending on a trigger. Triggers can be a scheduled job, a web server which is triggered through a web page request, or something that is running constantly and processing data \u2014 which could get quite expensive.\n\nWhat\u2019s really nice is that you don\u2019t have to worry about the operating system (memory, storage, CPU, security patches) as that is all managed for you \u2014 but at the same time it means that you do have limited flexibility since you cannot allocate resources directly.\n\nSome specific examples where Heroku can work nicely for you:\n\nHosting your own website where you want to write your own web server\n\nPeriodically scraping data from a website and then storing it on a database for analysis\n\nOffering an API server for a specific task. Things like offering weather data, storing Internet of Things sensor data, or a web service call for a machine learning model\n\nA database service (although a service such as Firebase is possibly better suited)\n\nHeroku Architecture\n\nHeroku provides a lightweight virtual machine (VM) for you to deploy your code. Note that under the free option, you can deploy up to 5 applications that are considered as 5 lightweight VMs. For your actual application, you are provided a separate URL subdomain under Heroku. So your project names need to be unique.\n\nThese workspaces have their own space for components such as: code and resource files (not dynamic data files), database (Postgres), and log files.\n\nOn your local desktop, Heroku uses your directory name to define your project, and also for Heroku to understand your context. So you can have multiple projects in different directories and when you run the Heroku commands \u2014 just make sure you do so in the right folder.\n\nThe one key thing that you do need to be aware of (which I discovered the hard way through hours of debugging \u2014 I wish I paid more attention to the documentation) is that everything is run from memory. There is no persistent storage. I\u2019ll say it again \u2014 you cannot store any files on the file server! For persistence, Heroku offers a postgress SQL database where you can add records as required.\n\nA simple example \u2014 website change detection\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step guide to get a working example of a simple service that will email you if a website has changed \u2014 basically a clone of www.changedetection.com. There will be several key components of this:\n\nA database that will store: (a) the email address to notify of a changed website; (b) the website to track; (c) the last \u2018copy\u2019 of the website A piece of code that will check a given website from the database in #1 (Python script) A job scheduler that will run the program in #2 (equivalent of a cron job) A web user interface where you can add/delete websites to monitor into the database mentioned in #1 A mechanism to send out emails\n\nUnderstanding these components will arm you with the skills to do a lot of things already. I learned all of these things through multiple sources, so this acts as a consolidated post.\n\nAssumptions\n\nThe following guide makes the following assumptions:\n\nYou have a GitHub account \u2014 if you don\u2019t, please create one here. You should also read this simple guide.\n\nYou already have a Heroku account \u2014 if you don\u2019t please create one here.\n\nYou are running a Windows machine \u2014 if not, it is fine, the instructions are quite similar in other environments\n\nYou already have Python installed \u2014 if you don\u2019t, please go here to install it\n\nYou can already program in Python \u2014 if not, then I\u2019d suggest you learn some of the basics first. Some guides are here.\n\nYou know SQL \u2014 if you don\u2019t, please go here.\n\nOverview of the steps\n\nI find that going through a \u2018walk before you can run\u2019 approach helps with the learning process. It also serves as documentation for yourself for how to solve each piece of the larger process. That way, if something breaks in your future endeavor, you have a better chance of figuring out where it went wrong.\n\nStep 1: Develop the web user interface \u2014 build Hello World first\n\nStep 2: Persistence \u2014 create a database\n\nStep 3: Check websites for changes\n\nStep 4: Send an email notification on changes\n\nStep 5: List the output on the web page\n\nStep 6: Deploy\n\nStep 1: Develop the web user interface \u2014 build Hello World first\n\nFirst, let\u2019s get a simple program deployed onto Heroku to get things started. This program will be a precursor to the web user interface (item #4) in the components list above. In order to serve up a page, we could simply have an HTML page, but then we would need to have a web server to server that file. In other words, when you type in the URL of the website, a program would need to interpret the request, then provide the contents of the HTML file. You can create your own mini web server with the Flask Python library, which is what we\u2019ll do.\n\nCreate a folder called webchecker and go into that directory (this directory name does not have to be the same as the Heroku application name)\n\nInstall the Flask library. Enter the command: npm Flask\n\nCreate the following Python program and name it showchecks.py:\n\nCode to create a simple webserver (our hello world) when you run the pyhton script locally\n\nBefore you deploy to Heroku, test that it works on your local PC. You can test it with the following steps:\n\nRun the program: python webchecker.com\n\nOpen up your browser on your local pc and open up the page: http://localhost:5000/hello\n\nRunning the script will return a static page with \u2018hello world\u2019 output\n\nNext, let\u2019s deploy this to Heroku. Before you can deploy, there needs to be a few more files that need to be included to help Heroku know more about your application.\n\nFirst, the requirements.txt\n\nrequirements.txt file that tells Heroku of the non-standard pyhton library files to include\n\nSecond, the file to tell Heroku what to run when a webrequest is made:\n\nProcfile file which tells Heroku which python script to run when the URL is called\n\nFinally, the runtime version of Python to use (default is 2.7, but we want to specify the latest version of Python):\n\nThe runtime.txt file which tells Heroku which version of python to use to run the script\n\nHence, you should have four files:\n\nshowchecker.py which is the code requirements.txt for the list of non-standard library dependencies. Whenever you have new libraries which are not part of the Python Standard Library \u2014 i.e. you need to install them using a tool such as \u201cpip\u201d \u2014 then add these here. You can find the version of an installed library such as Flask by running the command: pip show Flask in the command line Procfile which is the actual Python script to run when the website is called \u2014 make sure to update this if you change the Python file runtime.txt which is the actual version of python to use\n\nYou can deploy with the following steps from the command line:\n\nheroku create webchecker01 \u2014 buildpack heroku/python git add *.* * git status git commit -m \u201call files\u201d git push heroku master\n\nOnce you run the \u201cgit push heroku master\u201d, the deployment logs will be shown including the url where it is deployed\n\nFor the command #1 ( heroku create\u2026 ), the \u201cwebechecker01\u201d part is the unique name you\u2019ll need to provide for the name of the app.\n\nFor command #3 ( git status ) this will tell you what files are ready to be deployed. Make sure all files are there, if not add them using git add <filename> .\n\nNow you can check your website: <application name>.herokuapp.com/hello\n\nThe hello world program running on the web\n\nLet\u2019s also make sure we can see the logs since this is a great way to see what\u2019s going on with your app server. On your PC and in the webchecker directory, run the command: heroku logs\n\n\u201cheroku logs\u201d is a crucial command to run to see what\u2019s going on within your app server\n\nYou\u2019ll see the last execution steps. If things aren\u2019t working as expected, this is your first stop to find out more detail.\n\nYou can also go to the Heroku dashboard to see your consumption:\n\nhttps://dashboard.heroku.com\n\nStep 2: Persistence \u2014 create a database\n\nIn order to make more useful programs, you\u2019ll need to have a data store of sorts. This is where the Postgres database service comes into play. You first need to deploy the Heroku database service, then create your tables, and finally be able to connect to the database from your code locally (for testing).\n\nTo deploy a database service, first create it using the following command:\n\nheroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev\n\nNext, access the database from the command line and create your tables. The database is created on the Heroku cloud service and not locally. However, you can access it through the command line. To log on to the database via the console, run the command heroku pg:psql . Remember, you have to do it in your webchecker folder so that Heroku knows that it is the database for the webchecker site.\n\nTo see the list of tables type the command \\d\n\nTo create a table, you need to use normal SQL statements. For our webchecker program, let\u2019s create a table with the following columns:\n\nID \u2014 automatically generated ID for each entry (this will be the primary key). This is done by using the type \u201cserial\u201d\n\nwebsite \u2014 the website to monitor\n\nemailaddress \u2014 the email address to send the notification that a change has occurred\n\nlasthashcode \u2014 we won\u2019t store a copy of the whole webpage, instead we will generate a hash based on the HTML of the page, and then compare this each time. This is more efficient storage-wise, but will not tell us what actually changed\n\nlastchangedate \u2014 the date that the web changed last time. Hence we will get the database to default this with the current date\n\nTo create this table, enter the following command in the Heroku Postgres database console:\n\nCREATE TABLE webcheckerdb (id serial, website varchar(250), emailaddress varchar(250), lasthashcode varchar(32), lastchangedate timestamp DEFAULT current_date );\n\n(Make sure you include the semicolon at the end!)\n\nCreating the database, then using \\d switch to see the list of tables and then \u201c\\d webecheckerdb\u201d to see the columns\n\nNext, let\u2019s insert a single record in the database to ensure we have something to work with prior to getting our web UI up and running (you can use your own email address so it works in the future):\n\nINSERT into webcheckerdb values(DEFAULT, 'news.google.com', 'email@me.com', '', DEFAULT);\n\n(Make sure you include the semicolon at the end!)\n\nYou can then do a select statement (include the semicolon at the end!) to see the data\n\nYou can quit with \\q .\n\nStep 3: Check websites for changes\n\nFirst, let\u2019s get a piece of code to at least check if a hardcoded site can be retrieved (following on the concept of walking before running).\n\nHence, first step is to see if we can retrieve a webpage, hash it, and then compare it to a hardcoded hash. Create a new Python file called checkwebsite.py. Code here:\n\nRunning this will output the following:\n\nIf you have any errors with missing libraries, you can add them via: pip install <library> from the command line.\n\nNext, let\u2019s connect to the database with the following code:\n\nWhen you try to run this code, you are likely going to get an error of the form KeyError: \u2018DATABASE_URL\u2019 . This is because your Python code is trying to locate the web address of the Postgres database hosted on Heroku. This is automatically updated to the environment variable DATABASE_URL in the Heroku server. However, on your local PC you will have to do this manually:\n\nheroku config set DATABASE_URL=<the database string listed from \u201cheroku config\u201d>\n\nIf you get the DATABASE_URL error, then set the environment variable\n\nStep 4: Send an email notification on changes\n\nFinal step is to send an email. To do this, you\u2019ll need to install an Addon that has the ability to send emails \u2014 you can find these via the Heroku marketplace: https://elements.heroku.com/addons\n\nIn here, there is an Addon called SendGrid: https://elements.heroku.com/addons/sendgrid\n\nYou can add SendGrid to your app in the command line by typing:\n\nheroku addons:create sendgrid:starter\n\nWhen you go to your dashboard you can see the new Addon in the Resources section:\n\nSendGrid addon that can enable sending emails will be at the bottom\n\nBefore using it, you\u2019ll need to create an API key. Double click the SendGrid component above and go into Settings->API Key->Create Key (blue button on top right).\n\nClick on the Create Key button at top right\n\nOnce you create the key, copy it and go back to the command prompt and enter:\n\nheroku config:set SENDGRID_API_KEY=<API key from above>\n\nThis will only register it on the server, you need to add it locally to your desktop with:\n\nset SENDGRID_API_KEY=<API Key from above again>\n\nOnce done, you can test your code in a new Python script called sendmail.py. Install the library via pip install sendgrid :\n\nMake sure to update the email address to your email address!\n\nTo confirm the email was sent and delivered, you can go back to the SendGrid dashboard and checking the Statistics Overview screen:\n\nWhen checking your email, remember to check your spam.\n\nOnce it is working, there are only two lines of code you need to add to your main checkwebsite.py script. It is:\n\nimport sendmail #import the send email subroutine you wrote above\n\n...\n\n#call the subroutine after find the hashcode has changed\n\nsendmail.sendemail(webrecord['emailaddress'], 'Website changed', webrecord['website'] + ' changed')\n\nThe full code is here:\n\nStep 5: List the output on the web page and schedule the job\n\nThe next step is to list the output on the webpage.\n\nThis involves querying the database, and then cycling through and showing the data on your screen. Hence, it takes the \u2018Hello World\u2019 code above, and makes the modification. I also created a different path for this, so to test this out you\u2019ll need to go to the URL: http://localhost:5000/list\n\nAnd here\u2019s the output:\n\nStep 6: Deploy\n\nThe final step is to deploy everything to Heroku and then schedule the job so that it checks email.\n\nYou should have the following files:\n\nProcfile \u2014 the file which points to showchecker.py requirements.txt \u2014 the file which contains the library dependencies runtime.txt \u2014 the version of python showchecker.py \u2014 the python code which shows the database output on the web via <your appname>.herokuapp.com/list checkwebsite.py \u2014 the python code that checks for any changes on the websites\n\nFor the requirements.txt, you will need to make amendments to add the latest libraries:\n\nDeploy these all to Heroku:\n\ngit add *.* * git commit -m \u201cdeployment\u201d git push heroku master\n\nTest each component:\n\nGo to <your app name>.herokuapp.com/hello Go to <your app name>.herokuapp.com/list\n\nIf there are any errors, then run heroku logs in the command line to see what is going on.\n\nNext, run the checkwebsite.py directly on Heroku to make sure there are no issues. To do this, you can type:\n\nheroku run python checkwebsite.py\n\nThis is a great way to ensure your code is running as well on the heroku cloud as locally\n\nFinally, you can now schedule your job. Again, you need to include an Addon to do this.\n\nheroku addons:create scheduler:standard\n\nAnd you should be able to see the scheduler in your resources page:\n\nThe scheduler addon has been included as well which you can double click\n\nYou can simply use the command line to run the program, in our case it is: python checkwebsite.py (this is the same as what we tested above with the heroku run command).\n\nYou can schedule this with a few options.\n\nSummary\n\nAnd that\u2019s it\u2026 the first time it is a little complex, but hopefully the above incremental steps will help you understand what\u2019s going on under the hood. There are a lot more resources on Heroku as well as a wealth of information on Stack Overflow. These resources should make a lot more sense after going through the above.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nThanks for reading!

We'd also left off with a promise to look closer at the language's rather utopian origins, which still matter a great deal to Java's present and future.\n\nThe Java past\n\nBefore 1995, software was very often built with C and C++. These are not idiot-proof programming languages. It's possible\u2014easy even\u2014to really muck things up at very low levels within a computer, such as corrupting physical memory.\n\nIn my first computer science classes, I spent who knows how many hours trying to debug memory access violations, or trying to figure out \"memory leaks,\" where some sliver of physical memory is claimed by a program but never returned to the operating system. If that program or piece of code is run iteratively (again and again), the effect is that an increasing amount of physical memory (RAM, generally) is never released back to the OS. This has potentially serious consequences when it comes to performance.\n\nMemory leaks are sort of the canonical error associated with low-level programming. Java's answer was to add a feature called garbage collection. No longer would memory allocation and deallocation be the job of programmers. Instead, there would be another shadow program to keep tabs on things and properly dispose of no-longer-needed memory.\n\nWhere memory really matters is in systems that don't have a lot of it to spare: embedded systems. An embedded system is what we'd probably more likely call a thing in the Internet-of-Things. It's a small computer that controls some physical machine or interacts with the physical world in some specific way. The computer in a thermostat is an embedded system; an ATM is an embedded system; an Arduino board is an embedded system.\n\nThis was the original purpose of Java\u2014controlling things like TVs and smart appliances. It began within Sun Microsystems (now Oracle) in 1991 as the Oak programming language. James Gosling, one of the language's original developers, wrote at the time: \"the goal was ... to build a system that would let us do a large, distributed, heterogeneous network of consumer electronic devices all talking to each other.\"\n\nThe language's initial purpose didn't quite work out as the smart appliance dream (for a while, anyhow), so the language was retargeted at the web, where features like platform independence were still selling points. In 1995, a version of Netscape Navigator was released capable of running Java programs. You can read a lot more about Java Applets here, but for a good while these self-contained boxes running Java programs were the beginning and end of the interactive, dynamic web. Eventually, Applets would be mostly killed off by Javascript and CSS.\n\nThe Java future\n\nThe first part of this post was written in 2015 (sorry!). There have been some Java developments. To understand this, we need to understand something peculiar about Java that I haven't quite addressed. Recall that the central idea of Java code is that it actually runs on this intermediate entity called the Java Virtual Machine or JVM. This is like a ghost computer that lives between the language and the actual computer hardware below. This is where garbage collection is implemented, among other things.\n\nThe neat thing about the JVM is that it doesn't require Java. All it requires is Java bytecode. So, if you can make another programming language that can be converted into Java bytecode, then that language can run on the JVM and take advantage of its features.\n\nAnother quote from Gosling: \"Most people talk about Java the language, and this may sound odd coming from me, but I could hardly care less. At the core of the Java ecosystem is the JVM.\" A short list of JVM languages that are not Java includes Groovy, Clojure, and Cotlin. Nearly every popular programming language has at least one implementation that runs on the JVM. So, there are versions of Python, Javascript, PHP, and Ruby that all run on the JVM.\n\nBut the JVM language I want to talk about is Scala.\n\nScala is weird and also about to be incredibly important. Its weirdness is in its functional programming features. I'll write a separate post soon about functional programming, but for most programmers used to languages like Python and C++ and even normal Java it's a mindfuck. It's really a rewrite of some of the fundamental mechanics of programming where every computation reduces to the evaluation of a mathematical function, a rule for mutating a data point x into some new data point y.\n\nIn practice, functional programming is a way of operating on very large amounts of data using very small, very simple code. A classic operation would be a map function, which takes in a list of data and a formula that specifies how to modify a single data point. The map takes that formula and applies it to every data point and then returns a list of new data points.\n\nSomething like this:\n\nfunction addOne(number) = number + 1\n\nnewData = map(addOne, [1,2,3,4])\n\nAnd then newData will equal [2,3,4,5].\n\nScala adds some features to Java that make it really good at this sort of thing. Scala works very well when it comes to doing operations on large amounts of data in relatively simple ways, which makes it a natural candidate for distributed computing. This is where computations are done on very large datasets across many different CPUs located in potentially many different locations. Because of the memory constraints of most computers, this is neccessary for a lot of big datasets. And as data grows and grows, it's becoming more neccessary.\n\nThat's the problem solved by Apache Spark, a cluster-computing framework written in Scala and typically used within Scala applications. Spark is highly functional and a natural mate for Scala. Unlike fusty old Java, Spark and Scala are things that tend to get engineers excited in 2017.\n\nThere's more to the Java future than Scala and distributed computing, of course. There's the Android operating system, which is built around a JVM core. That probably speaks for itself.\n\nRead more Know Your Language.",

            "text": "The past week or so a lot of discussion and introspection has been happening in the Clojure community. Eric Normand responded to my one year Lambda Island post with some reflections on the size and growth of the community.\n\nAnd then Zack Maril lamented on Twitter: \u201cI\u2019m calling it, clojure\u2019s dying more than it is growing\u201d. This sparked a mega-thread, which was still raging four days later. A parallel discussion thread formed on Reddit. Someone asked if their were any Clojure failure stories. They were pointed at this talk from RubyConf 2016, which seemed to hit a lot of people right in the feels, and sparked a subthread with a life of its own.\n\nMeanwhile Ray, one of the hosts of the defn podcast reacted to the original tweet: \u201cI\u2019m calling it: Clojure is alive and well with excellent defaults for productive and sustainable software development.\u201d This sparked another big thread.\n\nFinally @phillmv, the person who did the talk that sparked so much debate, wrote his own summary of the discussion while reiterating some of his points in a blog post: Simple Ain\u2019t Easy, but Hard Ain\u2019t Simple: Leaving Clojure for Ruby.\n\nIt was all a bit much to be honest, but if we care about a healthy and growing Clojure community then it\u2019s important that we have these conversations. Let\u2019s try to unpack some of the points that were raised.\n\nClojure is dying\n\nThis statement initially set fire to the whole debate, but there seems to be little proof that this is true. This ask HN thread about who\u2019s using Clojure shows plenty of companies adopting it recently. The list of companies on Clojure.org mentions Amazon, Facebook, Deutsche Bank, eBay, PayPal, Oracle, ThoughtWorks, Red Hat, Salesforce, Walmart, and 271 others. Onyx raised 500\u2019000$US in funding last year, and the Taiwanese government is using Clojure for its citizen participation platform.\n\nThe community Slack grew from just over 6000 to close to 10K members in the past 12 months. Meetup.com lists 432 meetup groups that mention Clojure. We could definitely use more Clojure conferences, but with 8 annual conferences worldwide there are already twice as many as a few years back, and most of them seem to be growing in size year on year.\n\nOne personal observation: at my first EuroClojure in Berlin in 2013, most people I spoke to were enthusiasts. They programmed Java or Ruby or C# at their day jobs, and were dreaming of landing a Clojure job one day. At last year\u2019s EuroClojure in Bratislava it was the opposite, it seemed most people were doing Clojure professionally in some shape or form.\n\nSo it seems industry adoption has grown significantly, and continues to gather steam. Mindshare in the open source and developer enthusiast communities has grown more slowly, and it\u2019s worthwhile asking why that is.\n\n\u201cSimple vs. Easy\u201d vs. \u201cProgrammer Happiness\u201d\n\nWhat also hit the internet last week was David Nolen\u2019s talk from GOTO 2017, Id\u00e9e Fixe. It\u2019s a great talk. In his casual style he delivers some great insights. The central theme of the talk is \u201cfixed ideas\u201d standing in the way of progress. By becoming fixed on ideas which worked in the past, we lose the openness of mind needed to come up with novel ideas, even when experience or a changing context demonstrate that these old ideas no longer serve us.\n\nMuch of last week\u2019s debate has centered on AppCanary\u2019s choice to move back to Ruby, after a bad experience trying to build their platform in Clojure, and so it was a lot of \u201cClojure vs Ruby\u201d, both on a language level, and on a cultural and philosophical level. I have been doing Ruby since 2006 and Clojure since 2013, I spoke at Ruby and Clojure conferences, and I\u2019m intimately familiar with both of these languages and communities. I have some feels about this, y\u2019all.\n\nEach of these has their most prominent mantra. For Clojure it\u2019s \u201cSimple vs. Easy\u201d, while the Rubyist chant is \u201cOptimized for Programmer Happiness\u201d. What do these mean, really? And what are the blind spots, the things we are simply unable to see, because these fixed ideas are in the way?\n\nSimple vs. Easy\n\nAt Strange Loop 2011 Rich Hickey delivered one of his classic talks, Simple Made Easy, which would have a lasting effect on the discourse around Clojure. In it he contrasts \u201csimple\u201d with \u201ceasy\u201d. Simple is the opposite of complex, it is a measure of how entangled things are, of how much is folded and twisted into one. Simple software is focused, it does not interleave multiple concerns.\n\nEasy is the opposite of hard, it is a measure of the effort required to perform a task. This is largely subjective, something we are familiar with requires less effort, and so is perceived as easy.\n\nWhen the selling point of a framework is that you can \u201cbuild a blog in 15 minutes\u201d, or that a DSL \u201creads like English\u201d, then you\u2019re talking about ease. Ease helps us when initially writing code. It lets us move fast, and that is not undesirable.\n\nIn the longer run other aspects come to the foreground. Why is it that, as projects age, the speed of development tends to slow down? That it becomes harder to make changes? How do you build something non-trivial over time, while remaining confident in its quality and correctness?\n\nFor that you need to be able to reason about the system. Human minds can only juggle so many things at the same time, and because of this simplicity reigns supreme. We can become familiar with hard things and thus make them easy, but dealing with complexity will continue to hurt your brain. Years of practice won\u2019t change that.\n\nAnd so Rich\u2019s assertion is that many balls of mud sprang from a focus on ease, while sweeping complexity under the mat. And so he decided to build a language based on those features that promote simplicity, and rejecting those that lead to complexity.\n\nMutable state intertwines everything it touches. Objects mix functionality and state. Variables add a dimension of time to any code that references them.\n\nContrast that with immutable values, which are always local in time and space; pure functions, which can be reasoned about in isolation; reference types which make the dimension of time explicit by separating values from identities.\n\nClojure is not designed to be hard, to the contrary, I think a lot of thought has gone into making it easy to use as well, but when ease and simplicity are at odds, then simplicity always wins.\n\nProgrammer Happiness\n\nRuby\u2019s creator, Yukihiro Matsumoto (Matz for short), has stated repeatedly that Ruby is designed to make programmers happy.\n\nThe goal of Ruby is to make programmers happy. I started out to make a programming language that would make me happy, and as a side effect it\u2019s made many, many programmers happy.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t really spell out what those things are that make him happy, but we can gather some insight by looking at what he borrowed from other languages, and what he left out. What may surprise you is that, before creating Ruby, Matz\u2019s primary language was Lisp. Perl and Python are also cited as major influences. He wanted to build a modern object oriented scripting language, more suitable for building large systems than Perl, which he considered a toy language, and more pervasively object-oriented than Python, and so he borrowed the object model from Smalltalk.\n\nWhen it comes to modeling software Ruby comes closest to Smalltalk, while syntactically, Ruby feels more like Perl, once the favorite scripting language of hackers and tinkerers the world over. Perl is the brainchild of Larry Wall, by education a linguist. Perl is heavily inspired by natural language, it championed the idea that programming languages should be designed for the human doing the programming, not for the machine running the program. In his talk Perl, the first postmodern computer language, Larry says,\n\nSo, to drag the subject back to computers, one of the characteristics of a postmodern computer language is that it puts the focus not so much onto the problem to be solved, but rather onto the person trying to solve the problem. I claim that Perl does that, and I also claim that, on some level or other, it was the first computer language to do that.\n\nMuch of that talk goes into the contrast of a reductionist Modernism vs a more holistic postmodernism, it\u2019s a fascinating read, I highly recommend it.\n\nModernism, as a form of Classicalism, was always striving for simplicity, and was therefore essentially reductionistic. That is, it tended to take things to pieces. That actually hasn\u2019t changed much. It\u2019s just that Modernism tended to take one of the pieces in isolation and glorify it, while postmodernism tries to show you all the pieces at once, and how they relate to each other.\n\nThis still hasn\u2019t given us a clear sense of what is meant with \u201cprogrammer happiness\u201d, but I\u2019ll venture that it has to do with approaching things in a natural, organic way. Designing a language that appeals to the analytic and the creative and emotional brain equally. A language that loosens the straightjacket and lets you express yourself freely. Ruby promotes humane interfaces\n\nThe essence of the humane interface is to find out what people want to do and design the interface so that it\u2019s really easy to do the common case.\n\nEven when picking up a library for the first time you can often guess method names without looking at the docs. It just \u201cdoes what you would expect\u201d. Some even add aliases. Would you like some is_a? or do you prefer instance_of? ? It doesn\u2019t matter, they do the exact same thing!\n\nFixed ideas\n\nIs there any surprise that these two sides seem to be speaking past each other? It\u2019s like they live in different worlds. How can a Clojurist wearing their \u201cSimple vs Easy\u201d sunglasses ever comprehend the joy of creation sparking in the heart of a Rubyist? And how do we explain to the Ruby programmer the beauty of functional code, of having code and data laid bare, nothing up the sleeve, nothing tucked under the covers, just plain values, endlessly flowing, when all they can see is boilerplate code and single letter variable names?\n\nAnd yet each side has much to learn from the other, once we get past our fixed ideas.\n\n\u201cSimple Made Easy\u201d has instilled in many minds the notion that simple and easy are two sides of a spectrum, that they are necessarily at odds. But simple/complex and easy/hard are separate dimensions. While there\u2019s great merit in striving for simplicity, it would be a mistake to disregard ease. I think as Clojure programmers, as library authors, we have been too focused on the reductionist, on building solid parts. But it\u2019s only when these parts come together and meet the real world that magic happens.\n\nThe real world is messy, it\u2019s a complex tangle, a braiding of concerns and constraints. Dealing with that is why we are programmers, this is the real measure of our worth. At the heart of our systems we must strive for \u201csimple\u201d, but at the edges we must inspire, delight, make the impossible effortless. We must do this for our customers, and we must do this for our peers.\n\nEvery tool, every library forms an interface, a language that people must first master to convey their intent. Pay as much attention to designing these interfaces as you would designing their functional internals. This is the face with which your code looks upon the world. Make it smile with its eyes.\n\nTo quote Laozi,\n\nPeople usually fail when they are on the verge of success.\n\nSo give as much care to the end as to the beginning;\n\nThen there will be no failure.\n\nAnd Rubyists, you too have something to gain from this exchange. Yes, you\u2019ve been hearing for years of the benefits of immutable data, the elegance of pure functions. These are interesting ideas, but don\u2019t just read about them, try them out, use them in anger, and pay attention to how this influences the resulting system. You can do this in Ruby, but it will be hard to break out of old habits, so instead I recommend picking up a simpler, functional language, Clojure, OCaml, Elixir, and putting it through its paces. Afterwards you\u2019ll look at your Ruby projects with fresh eyes, and a new sense of where complexity comes from.\n\nI\u2019ll leave you with one more data point to ponder: Clojure has polymorphism, but it eschews concrete derivation. It has interfaces and protocols, but no inheritance chains. It\u2019s not a design decision that gets put in the limelight much, but it is one I encourage you to study. This alone has tremendous impact on how maintainable systems are.\n\nMINSWAN\n\nOne interesting thing that surfaced in the debates is that while some describe the Clojure community as \u201cincredibly friendly and helpful\u201d, others describe it as hostile. Well, which one is it? Again I think it\u2019s interesting to compare and contrast with the Ruby community.\n\nFrom my experience, the average interaction on Clojure\u2019s Slack, mailing lists or Github issues is polite and friendly. I see people tirelessly and patiently answering questions in the #beginners channel and elsewhere. People really want to help.\n\nAnd yet it\u2019s a very different vibe from what I see in the Ruby world. There people really go out of their way to be nice to each other. Github issues are accompanied by a bit more elaborate explanations, some emoji or animated gifs, because it\u2019s a low bandwith medium and you really want to make sure the human on the other side doesn\u2019t take things the wrong way. A phrase that was popular in the early days was \u201cMINSWAN\u201d, \u201cMatz is Nice So We Are Nice\u201d. It\u2019s something that deeply permeates this community, it\u2019s part of what made Rails Girls such a huge success, and it\u2019s why I still love going to Ruby conferences. It\u2019s a vibe that\u2019s hard to beat.\n\nThere are trolls in Rubyland too, but they get called out immediately. There is very little tolerance for less than friendly behavior. Virtually every conference and meetup has, and enforces, a Code of Conduct. Being welcoming, especially to beginners, is an essential part of Ruby\u2019s DNA. How to be and remain open and welcoming is an important part of the discourse.\n\nClojure is different, it\u2019s a mixed bunch. There are old-school lispers, converted Java programmers, people coming from other dynlangs like Ruby or Python, and they all carry different expectations. If you\u2019ve been active in open source for more than a decade you know that a thick skin was a basic requirement. Harsh interactions were par for the course. People do what they are used to, and without a guiding principle like MINSWAN it\u2019s harder to call people out and hold everyone to higher standards.\n\nIn the Clojure world, as in Clojure code, brevity is considered a feature, but there\u2019s a thin line between being concise, and being curt. People still try to be friendly and nice, but the dial isn\u2019t turned up all the way to 11. This is painfully true when it comes to the official docs, which seem to be written for machines rather than humans, it shows in the error messages, and it shows in many small online interactions.\n\nLanguages that draw a younger, more homogeneous crowd: Elm, Elixir, JavaScript, seem to be better at prioritizing the humanistic aspect. Both in the affordances of the software (Elm\u2019s famous error messages), and in person-to-person interactions. I think we can, and should, take a leaf out of their book.\n\nCatering for the Novice\n\nPeople cite many pain points when coming to Clojure. Chas Emerick summarized it well:\n\n\u2705 jvm pain\n\n\u2705 docs/error msgs\n\n\u2705 deployment pain\n\n\u2705 tooling/debugging pain\n\n\u2705 domain modeling difficulty\n\nThere\u2019s truth in all of these, and we as a community will have to stand up if we want to change these, but I want to focus on one more thing in particular: meeting the needs of the absolute beginner.\n\nThe Dreyfus model distinguishes five levels of competence, from novice to mastery. At the absolute beginner level people execute tasks based on \u201crigid adherence to taught rules or plans\u201d. Beginners need recipes. They don\u2019t need a list of parts, or a dozen different ways to do the same thing. Instead what works are step by step instructions that they can internalize. As they practice them over time they learn the reasoning behind them, and learn to deviate from them and improvise, but they first need to feel like they\u2019re doing something.\n\nI have taught many people Ruby on Rails. Rails is tremendously complex (and complected), but it gets this part right. In a few sessions you can teach a person to create an interactive website backed by a database. It\u2019s frustrating to teach because you\u2019re walking a tight rope. Just follow the steps. Don\u2019t peek under the covers. Don\u2019t stare into the abyss. But that feeling of instantly being productive is what draws people in, what makes them think, \u201chey, maybe I can do this\u201d.\n\nPeople criticize this as optimizing the wrong thing. Yes, initial prototyping goes really fast, but long term maintainability suffers. This criticism isn\u2019t without merit, but it tends to overlook this important aspect. \u201cThe Rails Way\u201d provides a framework that makes teaching easy. It means you can just dive in and ignore all the peripheral stuff until later.\n\nFor ClojureBridge we tend to teach graphics programming with Quil, with Nightcode as the editor. There the experience is similar. Within the first hour people are doing stuff, they\u2019re building things. And there are plenty of recipes out there for Quil that people can adopt and run with.\n\nBut in general, and for web development in particular, Clojure fails to deliver that experience. This may sound like a case for more of a \u201cframework\u201d and less of a \u201clibrary\u201d approach, but I think the bigger issue is documentation. We need more practical tutorials and how-to guides, that provide clear recommendations of tools and libraries to use, that explain things step by step, with empathy, with beginners in mind. Guides that you can follow from top to bottom and that actually work, even when you\u2019re on Windows, or Linux, or have never heard of a classpath.\n\nWe\u2019re also missing a dialogue about how to program, both in the small: how do you structure a function, what are common idioms, how do you manipulate data structures; and in the large: doing domain modeling, architecting systems, designing interfaces. Ruby folks talk about these things all the time, but talks like these are eerily absent from Clojure conferences, and yet it\u2019s something people consistently cite as a stumbling block.\n\nIf we want Clojure to continue to grow, we need to take responsibility for how it is perceived. Clojure is not always perceived as a friendly language. We can retort, \u201cit was very friendly to me\u201d, or we can listen without interrupting the speaker, believe they are speaking from good faith, and do better.\n\n\ud83e\udc45 You can comment (and upvote) on Reddit.com\n\nUpdate: The https://clojure.org web site has a guide section for tutorials and guides and accepts pull requests.\n\nMany thanks to Chas Emerick, Eric Normand, and Tobias Pfeiffer for reviewing an earlier version of this article.",

            "text": "Warts of the Scala Programming Language\n\nScala is my current favorite general-purpose programming language. However, it definitely has its share of flaws. While some are deep trade-offs in the design of the language, others are trivial, silly issues which cause frustration far beyond their level of sophistication: \"warts\". This post will explore some of what, in my opinion, are the warts of the Scala programming language, to hopefully raise awareness of their existence as problems and build a desire to fix them in the broader community.\n\nAbout the Author: Haoyi is a software engineer, an early contributor to Scala.js, and the author of many open-source Scala tools such as the Ammonite REPL and FastParse.\n\nIf you've enjoyed this blog, or enjoyed using Haoyi's other open source libraries, please chip in (or get your Company to chip in!) via Patreon so he can continue his open-source work\n\nI think that Scala has a disproportionate ratio of superficial-warts to deep-design-problems. While many languages have a relatively clean superficial syntax and semantics that hides a crazy and unpredictable core logic, Scala in my opinion has a relatively elegant core logic that's overlaid by a gnarly, messy superficial syntax and semantics.\n\nNot every problem with a programming language is a \"wart\". Many problems arise from deep design decisions and trade-offs, where there often isn't a \"correct\" solution, or where proposed solutions often come with their own share of (often unsolved) problems.\n\nHowever, many problems are simply incidental. They exist for no particular reason, have no particular benefit for being around, and have \"obvious\" solutions that would be non-controversial. They really should have been fixed years ago, though the second best time to fix them starts today.\n\nThis post will cover some things that I don't consider warts, to set the stage for exploring an incomplete list of things I consider the warts of the Scala programming language\n\nNot Warts\n\nJust because people complain about something doesn't mean it's a \"wart\".\n\nHere are a few of things in the Scala language that I don't consider to be warts:\n\nUniversal Equality\n\n@ val x = \"hello\" x: String = \"hello\" @ val y = 123 y: Int = 123 @ x == y res68: Boolean = false\n\nScala lets you compare any two values for equality via the == operator, which forwards to the Java .equals method under the hood defined a\n\ndef equals(other: Any): Boolean\n\nThis allows for all sorts of human mistakes to go uncaught at compile time: the above example will never return true , regardless of the values of x and y , and the compiler should be able to figure that out and tell us. While this example is short and the mistake is obvious, in larger examples it's much less obvious, e.g. in this example from Lincon Atkinson's blog:\n\n> \"foobar\".toList == List('f','o','o','b','a,'r') false\n\nDespite the fact that this seems to be letting through an obvious class of errors, it's not clear to me what the \"correct\" way of fixing it is:\n\nMost other programming languages follow this exact behavior: Java, C#, etc. all let you compare values willy-nilly even if their types mean can never be equal\n\nHaskell has an Eq type-class which seems like what we'd want: restricting comparisons only to types which it makes sense.\n\nThe Scala people have come up with a similar-but-different idea in their Multiversal Equality proposal.\n\nThe unsafe-ness of equality is a problem: making mistakes like this is very common in my experience. e.g. when refactoring a code to change String s to an Id class, you can fix all the compile errors, but all the equality checks are now invalid, and without the compiler's help you need to go hunt them all down manually. Furthermore, I'm sure there is a solution out there that can make things better, but the solution isn't \"trivial\" or \"obvious\" enough to make me consider this a Wart.\n\nRunning on the JVM\n\nScala has traditionally run on the JVM. It now runs on Javascript with Scala.js, and more recently on LLVM with Scala Native, but the heart of the ecosystem and all the tooling runs on the JVM.\n\nThis gives Scala all the benefits of the JVM: good stack traces, monitoring/deployment tools, a fast JIT and good garbage collectors, a tremendous ecosystem of libraries\n\nThis also gives Scala all the constraints of the JVM: boxing everywhere resulting in unnecessary GC pressure, a disk-heavy binary format for classfiles and jars, and a tremendously slow startup time for any non-trivial program.\n\nFor example, the Ammonite script-runner (which is a medium-sized command-line tool) spends up to half a second just classloading when running a script, before counting any actual program-logic being run:\n\nHowever, the reliance on the JVM is deep enough to be a core feature of the Scala language. It's debatable whether Scala would have been able to achieve the success it has without piggy-backing on all the JVM has to offer. While it would be nice to slowly reduce that reliance, which is happening now with Scala.js and Scala-Native, it's a hard trade-off that I can't consider a Wart.\n\nType-erasure\n\n@ val x = List(1, 2, 3) x: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3) @ val y = x.asInstanceOf[List[String]] y: List[String] = List(1, 2, 3) @ println(y.last) java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to java.lang.String $sess.cmd76$.<init>(cmd76.sc:1) $sess.cmd76$.<clinit>(cmd76.sc:-1)\n\nOn the JVM, and now on the Javascript platform using Scala.js, generic types are erased: that means you can asInstanceOf or isInstanceOf or pattern-match against them, and they always are considered equal. That results in the above behavior, where you can cast a List[Int] into a List[String] without any errors (though it gives off a warning) and it only crashes at runtime when you try to extracta value from the already casted list!\n\nThis behavior is clearly unsafe, and can result in weird and hard-to-track-down problems. However, it's not clear to me what the correct behavior is:\n\nYou could not-erase generic types, like in C#, which contains a performance cost when compiling to the JVM and Javascript and makes interop with erased JVM libraries less convenient.\n\nYou could erase even more, like in Scala.js, where even the top-level types are (partially) erased at runtime, meaning the above example runs perfectly fine without any errors!\n\n// Scala.js val x = List(1, 2, 3) val y = x.asInstanceOf[List[String]] println(y.last) // 3\n\n\"Full\" erasure on Scala.js for Javascript types also allows for several interesting features, such as phantom-types and zero-overhead wrapper-types, that are difficult/impossible to do on the JVM without jumping through hoops. It also allows much more aggressive optimizations, since the optimizer no longer needs to keep adding guards to throw ClassCastExceptions if you get a cast wrong. The cost of this is you get more confusing error messages if you write invalid casts. In my experience, this is basically a non-issue in practice, since \"typical\" Scala programs tend not to rely on casts.\n\nLastly, it could be argued that having \"Full\" erasure helps enforce parametricity/encapsulation: you can no longer check what class something is when calling a method, and are thus forced to rely on whatever abstract interface you are provided with.\n\nHence, I don't know what the correct answer is here. There are good arguments why both \"more erasure\" and \"less erasure\" are good things, so without a obvious better-way I don't consider this a Wart.\n\nImplicits\n\nScala allows implicit parameters, which can be passed manually but can also be automatically passed to functions that require them based on their type. For example, in the following case, we call the repeat function twice: once passing in count manually as 2, an once passing it implicitly via the implicit val c which is 3 :\n\n@ def repeat(s: String)(implicit count: Int) = s * count defined function repeat @ repeat(\"hello\")(2) res78: String = \"hellohello\" @ repeat(\"hello\") cmd79.sc:1: could not find implicit value for parameter count: Int val res79 = repeat(\"hello\") ^ Compilation Failed @ implicit val c = 3 c: Int = 3 @ repeat(\"hello\") res80: String = \"hellohellohello\"\n\nScala also allows implicit conversions, that can be used to define automatic conversions from out type to another:\n\n@ case class Name(s: String){ require(s.nonEmpty) } defined class Name @ val n1 = Name(\"hello\") n1: Name = Name(\"hello\") @ val n2 = Name(\"\") java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: requirement failed scala.Predef$.require(Predef.scala:264) $sess.cmd81$Name.<init>(cmd81.sc:2) $sess.cmd83$.<init>(cmd83.sc:1) $sess.cmd83$.<clinit>(cmd83.sc:-1) @ implicit def autoName(s: String): Name = Name(s) defined function autoName @ val n3: Name = \"hello\" n3: Name = Name(\"hello\") @ val n3: Name = \"\" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: requirement failed scala.Predef$.require(Predef.scala:264) $sess.cmd81$Name.<init>(cmd81.sc:2) $sess.cmd84$.autoName(cmd84.sc:1) $sess.cmd86$.<init>(cmd86.sc:1) $sess.cmd86$.<clinit>(cmd86.sc:-1)\n\nWhile this behavior may be confusing, unintuitive and hard-to-debug sometimes, it also forms the basis for a large number of common Scala design patterns. Scala wouldn't be Scala without implicits.\n\nThe actual implementation of implicits contains many strange corner cases, in addition to out-right bugs, but implicits themselves are so core to Scala that I don't think they could be considered a \"wart\"\n\nWarts\n\nWarts are somewhere on the spectrum between design issues and outright bugs. These are things that, I think, have obvious solutions that would be both easy and relatively uncontroversial to fix, that nonetheless cause annoyance and frustration disproportionate given how trivial the issue is.\n\nThe warts I'm going to discuss are:\n\nWeak eta-expansion\n\nScala maintains a distinction between \"functions\" and \"methods\": in general, methods are things you call on an object, whereas functions are objects themselves. However, since they're so similar (\"things you can call\"), it gives you a way to easily wrap a method in a function object called \"eta expansion\"\n\n@ def repeat(s: String, i: Int) = s * i defined function repeat @ repeat(\"hello\", 2) res89: String = \"hellohello\" @ val func = repeat _ func: (String, Int) => String = $sess.cmd90$$$Lambda$2796/1082786554@2a3983b9 @ func(\"hello\", 3) res91: String = \"hellohellohello\"\n\nAbove, we use the underscore _ to assign repeat _ to a value func , which is then a function object we can call. This can happen automatically, without the _ , based on the \"expected type\" of the place the method is being used. For example, if we expect func to be a (String, Int) => String , we can assign repeat to it without the _ :\n\n@ val func: (String, Int) => String = repeat func: (String, Int) => String = $sess.cmd92$$$Lambda$2803/669946146@46226d53 @ func(\"hello\", 3) res92: String = \"hellohellohello\"\n\nOr by stubbing out the arguments with _ individually:\n\n@ val func = repeat(_, _) func: (String, Int) => String = $sess.cmd98$$$Lambda$2832/1025548997@358b1f86\n\nThis works, but has a bunch of annoying limitations. Firstly, even though you can fully convert the method repeat into a (String, Int) => String value using _ , you cannot partially convert it:\n\n@ val func = repeat(\"hello\", _) cmd4.sc:1: missing parameter type for expanded function ((x$1: <error>) => repeat(\"hello\", x$1)) val func = repeat(\"hello\", _) ^ Compilation Failed\n\nUnless you know the the \"expected type\" of func , in which case you can partially convert it:\n\n@ val func: Int => String = repeat(\"hello\", _) func: Int => String = $sess.cmd93$$$Lambda$2808/1138545802@2c229ed2\n\nOr you provide the type to the partially-applied-function-argument _ manually:\n\n\n\n@ repeat(\"hello\", _: Int) res4: Int => String = $sess.cmd4$$$Lambda$1988/1407003104@5eadc347\n\nThis is a bit strange to me. If I can easily convert the entire repeat method into a function without specifying any types, why can I not convert it into a function if I already know one of the arguments? After all, I have provided strictly more information in the repeat(\"hello\", _) case than I have in the repeat(_, _) case, and yet somehow type inference got worse!\n\nFurthermore, there's a more fundamental issue: if I know that repeat is a method that takes two arguments, why can't I just do this?\n\n@ val func = repeat cmd99.sc:1: missing argument list for method repeat in object cmd88 Unapplied methods are only converted to functions when a function type is expected. You can make this conversion explicit by writing `repeat _` or `repeat(_,_)` instead of `repeat`. val func = repeat ^ Compilation Failed\n\nAfter all, since the compiler already knows that repeat is a method, and that it doesn't have it's arguments provided, why not convert it for me? Why force me to go through the _ or (_, _) dance, or why ask me to provide an expected type for func if it already knows the type of repeat ?\n\nIn other languages with first-class functions, like Python, this works fine:\n\n>>> def repeat(s, i): ... return s * i ... >>> func = repeat >>> func(\"hello\", 3) 'hellohellohello'\n\nThe lack of automatic eta-expansion results in people writing weird code to work around it, such as this example from ScalaMock:\n\n\"drawLine\" should \"interact with Turtle\" in { // Create mock Turtle object val mockedTurtle = mock[Turtle] // Set expectations (mockedTurtle.setPosition _).expects(10.0, 10.0) (mockedTurtle.forward _).expects(5.0) (mockedTurtle.getPosition _).expects().returning(15.0, 10.0) // Exercise System Under Test drawLine(mockedTurtle, (10.0, 10.0), (15.0, 10.0)) }\n\nHere, the weird (foo _) dance is something that they have to do purely because of this restriction in eta-expansion.\n\nWhile I'm sure there are good implementation-reasons why this doesn't work, I don't see any reason this shouldn't work from a language-semantics point of view. From a user's point of view, methods and functions are just \"things you call\", and Scala is generally successful and not asking you to think about the distinction between them.\n\nHowever, in cases like this, I think there isn't a good reason the compiler shouldn't try a bit harder to figure out what I want before giving up and asking me to pepper _ s or expected types all over the place. The compiler already has all the information it needs - after all, it works if you put an _ after the method - and it just needs to use that information when the _ isn't present.\n\nCallers of zero-parameter methods can decide how many parens to use\n\nScala lets you leave off empty-parens lists when calling functions. This looks kind of cute when calling getters:\n\n@ def getFoo() = 1337 defined function foo @ getFoo() res8: Int = 1337 @ getFoo res9: Int = 1337\n\nHowever, it doesn't really make sense when you consider how this works in most other languages, such as Python:\n\n>>> def getFoo(): ... return 1337 ... >>> getFoo() 1337 >>> func = getFoo >>> func() 1337\n\nAfter all, if getFoo() is a Int , why shouldn't getFoo without the parens be a () => Int ? After all, calling a () => Int with parens give you an Int . However, in Scala methods are \"special\", as shown above, and methods with empty parens lists are treated even more specially.\n\nFurthermore, this feature really doesn't make sense when you start pushing it:\n\n@ def bar()()()()() = 2 defined function bar @ bar res11: Int = 2 @ bar() res12: Int = 2 @ bar()() res13: Int = 2 @ bar()()() res14: Int = 2 @ bar()()()() res15: Int = 2 @ bar()()()()() res16: Int = 2 @ bar()()()()()() cmd17.sc:1: Int does not take parameters val res17 = bar()()()()()() ^ Compilation Failed\n\nIs this really the behavior we expect in a statically-typed language, that you can call this method with any number of argument lists 0 < n <= 5 and it'll do the same thing regardless? What on earth is the type of bar ? The Scala community likes to think that it's \"definition-side variance\" is better than Java's \"use-site variance\", but here we have Scala providing definition-site parens where every caller of bar can pick and choose how many parens they want to pass.\n\nI think the solution to this is clear: methods should be called with as many sets of parentheses as they are defined with (excluding implicits). Any method call missing parens should be eta-expanded into the appropriate function value.\n\nConcretely, that means that given these two functions:\n\nobject thing{ def head: T = ??? def next(): T = ??? }\n\nThey currently behave like this:\n\nval first1: T = thing.head // Works! val first2: T = thing.head() // Compile Error: T is not a function and cannot be called val first3: T = thing.next // Works! val first4: T = thing.next() // Works!\n\nAnd will there-after behave like this:\n\nval first1: T = thing.head // Works! val first2: T = thing.head() // Compile Error: T is not a function and cannot be called val first3: T = thing.next // Compile Error: found () => T, expected T val first4: T = thing.next() // Works!\n\nNotably, this does not take away the ability to control how many empty-parens a function is called with; rather, it shifts that decision from the user of a function to the author of a function. Since the author of a function already decides everything else about it (It's name, arguments, return type, implementation, ...) giving the author the decision over empty-parens would not be unprecedented.\n\nNo-parens \"property\" functions would still be possible, the author of the function would just need to define it without parens, as is already possible:\n\n@ def baz = 3 defined function baz @ baz res11: Int = 3 @ baz() cmd12.sc:1: Int does not take parameters val res12 = baz() ^ Compilation Failed\n\nThe only reason I've heard for this feature is to \"let you call Java getFoo methods without the parens\", which seems like an exceedingly weak justification for a language feature that so thoroughly breaks the expectations of a statically-typed language. If that was the problem, one option would be to allow use-site optional empty-parentheses only at Java call-sites or Scala call-sites with a particular annotation ( @optionalParens def foo = ... ?). This would limit the scope of this behavior to a mild Java-interop quirk (one of many), rather than a wart affecting the core of the Scala programming language\n\nNeeding curlies/case for destructuring anonymous functions\n\nScala lets you create anonymous functions with a x => x + 1 syntax:\n\n@ Seq(1, 2, 3).map(x => x + 1) res44: Seq[Int] = List(2, 3, 4)\n\nBut if you want to have the function work on e.g. Tuples, that doesn't work:\n\n@ Seq((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)).map((x, y) => x + y + 1) cmd45.sc:1: missing parameter type Note: The expected type requires a one-argument function accepting a 2-Tuple. Consider a pattern matching anonymous function, `{ case (x, y) => ... }` val res45 = Seq((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)).map((x, y) => x + y + 1) ^ cmd45.sc:1: missing parameter type val res45 = Seq((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)).map((x, y) => x + y + 1) ^ Compilation Failed\n\nAnd you need to then swap over to a similar-but-annoyingly-different { case ... => ...} syntax:\n\n@ Seq((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)).map{case (x, y) => x + y + 1} res45: Seq[Int] = List(4, 8, 12)\n\nThere are two changes here:\n\nNeeding the strange case just to destructure a tuple. Can't the compiler see that it's getting a (A, B) => C function, needs a (Tuple[A, B]) => C function, and convert it automatically?\n\nNeeding the curly brackets, rather than parens. After all, even if we demanded the case keyword, there's no reason that Seq(1, 2, 3).map(case x => x + 1) shouldn't work\n\nHappily, both these limitations are slated to go away in a future version. However, right now they are definitely an unnecessary, trivial annoyance when writing Scala.\n\nExtraneous extension methods on Any\n\nScala adds a bunch of extension methods on every value in your codebase:\n\n@ 1.ensuring(_ > 2) java.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed scala.Predef$.assert(Predef.scala:204) scala.Predef$Ensuring$.ensuring$extension2(Predef.scala:316) $sess.cmd25$.<init>(cmd25.sc:1) $sess.cmd25$.<clinit>(cmd25.sc:-1) @ 1.formatted(\"hello %s\") res26: String = \"hello 1\" @ 1.synchronized(println(\"yo\")) yo\n\nIt really shouldn't. In my experience, there extension methods are rarely ever used. If someone wants to use them, they can import the functions themselves or write their own extensions. It doesn't make any sense to pollute the method-namespace of every value in existance to add some unused functionality.\n\nConvoluted de-sugaring of for-comprehensions\n\nScala lets you write for-comprehensions, which are converted into a chain of flatMap s an map s as shown below:\n\n@ val (x, y, z) = (Some(1), Some(2), Some(3)) x: Some[Int] = Some(1) y: Some[Int] = Some(2) z: Some[Int] = Some(3) @ for{ i <- x j <- y k <- z } yield i + j + k res40: Option[Int] = Some(6) @ desugar{ for{ i <- x j <- y k <- z } yield i + j + k } res41: Desugared = x.flatMap{ i => y.flatMap{ j => z.map{ k => i + j + k } } }\n\nI have nicely formatted the desugared code for you, but you can try this yourself in the Ammonite Scala REPL to verify that this is what the for-comprehension gets transformed into.\n\nThis is a convenient way of implementing nested loops over lists, and happily works with things that aren't lists: Option s (as shown above), Future s, and many other things.\n\nYou can also assign local values within the for-comprehension, e.g.\n\n@ for{ i <- x j <- y foo = 5 k <- z } yield i + j + k + foo res42: Option[Int] = Some(11)\n\nThe syntax is a bit wonky (you don't need a val , you can't define def s or class es or run imperative commands without _ = println(\"debug\") ) but for simple local assignments it works. You may expect the above code to be transformed into something like this\n\nres43: Desugared = x.flatMap{ i => y.flatMap{ j => val foo = 5 z.map{ k => i + j + k } } }\n\nBut it turns out it instead gets converted into something like this:\n\n@ desugar{ for{ i <- x j <- y foo = 5 k <- z } yield i + j + k + foo } res43: Desugared = x.flatMap(i => y.map{ j => val foo = 5 scala.Tuple2(j, foo) }.flatMap((x$1: (Int, Int)) => (x$1: @scala.unchecked) match { case Tuple2(j, foo) => z.map(k => i + j + k + foo) } ) )\n\nAlthough it is roughly equivalent, and ends up with the same result in most cases, this output format is tremendously convoluted and wastefully inefficient (e.g. creating and taking-apart unnecessary Tuple2 s). As far as I can tell, there is no reason at all not to generated the simpler version of the code shown above.\n\nFor-comprehensions syntax restrictions\n\nAs mentioned above, you cannot have def s, class es, or imperative statements in the generators of a for-comprehension:\n\nscala> for{ | i <- Seq(1) | println(i) | j <- Seq(2) <console>:4: error: '<-' expected but ';' found. j <- Seq(2) ^\n\nThis is a rather arbitrary restriction, and as far as I can tell doesn't serve any purpose, and forces you to put random _ = prefixes on your statements to make things compile:\n\nscala> for{ | i <- Seq(1) | _ = println(i) | j <- Seq(2) | } yield j 1 res0: Seq[Int] = List(2)\n\nThere really isn't any reason that this shouldn't work out-of-the-box, and convert say:\n\nfor{ i <- Seq(1) def debug(s: Any) = println(\"Debug \" + s) debug(i) j <- Seq(2) debug(j) k <- Seq(3) } yield i + j + k\n\nInto\n\nSeq(1).flatMap{ i => def debug(s: Any) = println(\"Debug \" + s) debug(i) Seq(2).flatMap{ j => debug(j) Seq(3).map{ k => i + j + k } } }\n\nAbstract/non-final case classes\n\nYou can inherit from case classes and extend them with new functionality:\n\n@ case class Foo(i: Int) defined class Foo @ Foo(1) res18: Foo = Foo(1) @ Foo(1).i res19: Int = 1 @ class Bar extends Foo(1) defined class Bar @ (new Bar).i res21: Int = 1\n\nYou can even declare it an abstract case class to force someone to inherit from it rather than instantiating it directly. If you want your case class to not allow inheritance you should label it final\n\nAs far as I can tell, \"nobody\" does any of this: people don't inherit from case classes, declare their case classes abstract , or rememebr to mark them final . Literally the only programmer I've ever seen making good use of abstract case classes and inheritance is probably Martin Odersky himself. I think we should disallow it, and just force people to use normal classes if they want to inherit from them.\n\nClasses cannot have only implicit parameter lists\n\nThis doesn't work:\n\n@ class Foo(i: Int) defined class Foo @ new Foo(1) res50: Foo = $sess.cmd49$Foo@7230510 @ class Bar(implicit i: Int) defined class Bar @ new Bar(1) cmd52.sc:1: no arguments allowed for nullary constructor Bar: ()(implicit i: Int)$sess.cmd51.Bar val res52 = new Bar(1) ^ Compilation Failed\n\nBut this does:\n\n@ new Bar()(1) res52: Bar = $sess.cmd51$Bar@467de021\n\nThis one straddles the line between \"Wart\" and \"Bug\", but definitely should be fixed so that a class defined with one argument list doesn't magically sprout two.\n\nDid you know the presence or absence of comments can affect the logic of your program?\n\n@ object Foo{ def bar(x: Any) = println(\"Foo#bar(x) \" + x) def bar = println(\"Foo#bar\") } defined class Foo @ val baz = 1 baz: Int = 1 @ { Foo bar baz } Foo#bar(x) 1 @ { Foo bar baz } Foo#bar @ { Foo bar // Wooo! baz } Foo#bar(x) 1 @ { Foo bar // Wooo! baz } Foo#bar @ { Foo bar // Wooo! // Hoo! baz } Foo#bar(x) 1\n\nAs you can see, this code behaves differently if we have a line between the Foo bar and the baz , unless that line has a line comment on it! When there's no newlines or the newline is filled by a comment, Foo.bar(x: Any) gets called, and when there's a newline not filled by a comment then the other overload Foo.bar gets called.\n\nThere are other places in the language syntax where this is the case:\n\n@ { class X(x: Int)(y: Int) new X(1)(2) class Y(x: Int) (y: Int) new Y(1)(2) } defined class X res103_1: X = $sess.cmd103$X@6a58eda9 defined class Y res103_3: Y = $sess.cmd103$Y@136ca935 @ { class Z(x: Int) (y: Int) } cmd105.sc:3: not found: value y val res105_1 = (y: Int) ^ Compilation Failed @ { class W(x: Int) // Woohoo (y: Int) } defined class W\n\nA full listing of the places where this \"comment can change behavior of newlines\" can be found in the OneNLMax rule of the ScalaParse grammar. I don't have an immediate answer for what the correct solution is here, but I'm 99.9% sure we should make it so comments like this don't affect the semantics of a Scala program!\n\nConflating total destructuring with partial pattern-matching\n\nThe following example, also from Lincon Atkinson's blog, compiles without warning and fails with an exception at runtime:\n\n@ val (a, b, c) = if (true) \"bar\" else Some(10) scala.MatchError: bar (of class java.lang.String) $sess.cmd105$.<init>(cmd105.sc:1) $sess.cmd105$.<clinit>(cmd105.sc:-1)\n\nThe basic problem here is that when Scala sees val (a, b, c) = ... , it doesn't mean which of two things you mean:\n\nHelp me extract the values from ... , and help me check that it's a tuple Help me extract the values from ... , and fail at runtime if it is not a tuple\n\nCurrently, it assumes the latter, in all cases.\n\nThat makes any sort of \"destructuring assignment\" unchecked, and thus extremely unsafe.\n\nThe above example at least happily fails with an exception, but the following exhibits the same problem, but instead truncates your data silently, losing the 5 :\n\n@ for((a, b) <- Seq(1 -> 2, 3 -> 4, 5)) yield a + \" \" + b res107: Seq[String] = List(\"1 2\", \"3 4\")\n\nThough the following also fails with an exception:\n\n@ Seq(1 -> 2, 3 -> 4, 5).map{case (a, b) => a + \" \" + b} scala.MatchError: 5 (of class java.lang.Integer) $sess.cmd108$.$anonfun$res108$1(cmd108.sc:1) scala.collection.TraversableLike.$anonfun$map$1(TraversableLike.scala:234) scala.collection.immutable.List.foreach(List.scala:389) scala.collection.TraversableLike.map(TraversableLike.scala:234) scala.collection.TraversableLike.map$(TraversableLike.scala:227) scala.collection.immutable.List.map(List.scala:295) $sess.cmd108$.<init>(cmd108.sc:1) $sess.cmd108$.<clinit>(cmd108.sc:-1)\n\nWhile interpretation #2 makes sense in match blocks and partial-functions, where you expect to \"fall through\" to the next handler if it doesn't match, it doesn't make much sense in cases like this where there is nowhere to fall through to.\n\nThe correct solution would look something like this:\n\nBy default, assume the user wants 1. \"Help me extract the values from ... , and help me check that it's a tuple\"\n\nRequire a special keyword if the user wants 2. \"Help me extract the values from ... , and fail at runtime if it is not a tuple\"\n\nA possible syntax might be using case , which Scala developers already associate with partial functions and pattern matches:\n\nfor(case (a, b) <- Seq(1 -> 2, 3 -> 4, 5)) yield a + \" \" + b case val (a, b, c) = if (true) \"bar\" else Some(10)\n\nThis would indicate that you want to perform an \"partial fail at runtime\" match, and the earlier non- case examples:\n\nfor((a, b) <- Seq(1 -> 2, 3 -> 4, 5)) yield a + \" \" + b val (a, b, c) = if (true) \"bar\" else Some(10)\n\nCould then verify that the pattern match is complete, otherwise fail at compile time.\n\nConclusion\n\nMost of the warts listed here are not inherent to the \"core\" of the Scala language: types, values, classes, traits, functions, and implicits. None of them are particularly deep, nor should they be very controversial. This list is obviously neither objective nor comprehensive.\n\nNevertheless, these warts are annoying far beyond their level of sophistication, and especially pose a barrier to newbies (such as myself, six years ago) who haven't learned to \"tune out the noise\" and \"jump through the hoops\" to be able to work with Scala's elegant core.\n\nI don't have the capability to contribute fixes to all of these myself, but hopefully by publishing this I'll be able to raise awareness in the community about such problems, and add pressure so that some day all these sharp corners can be sanded down to reveal Scala's true elegance.\n\nIf you have your own favorite warts in the Scala language, let us know in the comments below!",

Students have been caught borrowing computer code from their friends or cribbing it from the internet.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of discussion about it, both inside a department as well as across the field,\u201d said Randy H. Katz, a professor in the electrical engineering and computer science department at the University of California, Berkeley, who discovered in one year that about 100 of his roughly 700 students in one class had violated the course policy on collaborating or copying code.\n\nComputer science professors are now delivering stern warnings at the start of each course, and, like colleagues in other subjects, deploy software to flag plagiarism. They have unearthed numerous examples of suspected cheating.\n\nAt Brown University, more than half the 49 allegations of academic code violations last year involved cheating in computer science.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt Stanford, the alma mater of the founders of Google, Snapchat and countless other internet wonders, as many as 20 percent of the students in one 2015 computer science course were flagged for possible cheating.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd at Harvard, where Computer Science 50 is practically its own brand, with T-shirts, slickly produced videos and an online audience of thousands, the class distinguished itself last fall in a more dubious way: According to The Harvard Crimson, more than 60 students were referred to the university\u2019s honor council, a committee that reviews allegations of academic dishonesty, such as plagiarism, and violations of the honor code.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn interviews, professors and students said the causes were not hard to pin down.\n\nTo some students drawn to the classes, coding does not come easily. The coursework can be time-consuming. Troves of code online, on sites like GitHub, may have answers to the very assignment the student is wrestling with, posted by someone who previously took the course.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got kids who were struggling with spending a third of their time on their problem sets with the option to copy from the internet,\u201d said Jackson Wagner, who took the Harvard course in 2015 and was not accused of copying. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason why people cheat.\u201d\n\nComplicating matters is the collaborative ethos among programmers, which encourages code-sharing in ways that might not be acceptable in a class. Professors also frequently allow students to discuss problems among themselves, but not to share actual code, a policy that some students say creates confusion about what constitutes cheating.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe executive committee at Yale, where five students were accused of copying code last fall, though a couple had charges withdrawn, acknowledged as much.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cIt is often such a complex task to read these guidelines,\u201d wrote the committee chairman, Paul North, a professor of German, \u201cthat the code to be written seems simple in comparison.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPenalties can be as small as a zero on an assignment, which is what the Purdue students received; they were also docked a letter in the course\u2019s final grade. (Dr. Dunsmore credits awareness of such penalties with a reduction in cheating in his courses over the last decade.) More serious or repeated infractions can lead to failing the course, or even suspension.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt some colleges, computer science courses have become a leading source of academic dishonesty complaints. But many computer science professors reject any notion that their students are more prone to cheating than others. Cheating scandals have cropped up in other subjects in recent years, including in a government class at Harvard and in a Dartmouth class on sports, religion and ethics.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But other times it is a red flag.\n\nPlagiarizers might try to cover their tracks by replacing words with synonyms, like 0 instead of NULL, or replacing the original author\u2019s names for variables with their own. In a hypothetical example of cheating he sometimes sees, Thomas Doeppner, the vice chairman of computer science at Brown, provided a snippet of coding for a program that finds a path through a maze:\n\nstruct visit_list node;\n\nnode.row = row;\n\nnode.col = col;\n\nnode.next = NULL;\n\nSomeone copying the code, he said, might render it this way:\n\nstruct rooms_visited room;\n\nroom.r = r;\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nroom.c = c;\n\nroom.link = 0;\n\nUsually, anti-cheating software can uncover these tricks. One, developed by Dr. Aiken, is called MOSS, for Measure of Software Similarity. Another program, developed by a British company, Codio, monitors students\u2019 keystrokes; a sudden burst raises questions about where the code came from.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt Harvard, David J. Malan, the CS50 professor, introduced a \u201cregret clause,\u201d letting students who cheat and admit it within 72 hours receive an unsatisfactory or failing grade on the assignment, and avoid further discipline \u2014 unless they do it again.\n\nBut in last fall\u2019s CS50, an unusually large number of cheating allegations \u2014 involving more than 60 out of 655 students, The Crimson reported \u2014 were reported by Professor Malan or his staff to Harvard\u2019s academic honor council.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nProfessor Malan said one reason for the large number of cases was that instructors were scrutinizing students\u2019 work more carefully than before. He also said that since students could use the regret clause, instructors felt more comfortable going to the honor council when students had passed up that chance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe referred questions about the outcomes of the cheating complaints to a university spokeswoman, who said she could not discuss the cases because of student privacy.\n\nTwo Harvard students who said they were familiar with some of the violations, and who wanted to be anonymous for fear of repercussions from the university, described one of the more blatant examples: A student submitted code using a computer language, PHP, that had been taught in a previous year, but not last fall.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome students suggested that in other cases there was a fine line between reasonable sharing and improper copying, particularly because the professor encourages students to discuss problems with one another.\n\n\u201cThere is a gray area as to how much help one can get,\u201d said Javier Cuan-Martinez, the president of the Harvard Computer Society, who took the course two years ago.\n\nProfessor Malan, in an email, said the guidelines in the course syllabus were clear. One rule says that when asking for help, you may have your code viewed by others, but you may not view theirs. \u201cWhenever a line is actually crossed,\u201d Professor Malan wrote, \u201cit\u2019s often that one.\u201d",

            "text": "This post is the first in a series of tutorials for implementing machine learning workflows in Python from scratch, covering the coding of algorithms and related tools from the ground up. The end result will be a handcrafted ML toolkit. This post starts things off with data preparation.\n\nBy Matthew Mayo, KDnuggets.\n\nIt seems that, anymore, the perception of machine learning is often reduced to passing a series of arguments to a growing number of libraries and APIs, hoping for magic, and awaiting the results. Maybe you have a very good idea of what's going on under the hood in these libraries -- from data preparation to model building to results interpretation and visualization and beyond -- but you are still relying on these various tools to get the job done.\n\n\n\nMachine learning workflows in Python. From scratch.\n\nAnd that's fine. Using well-tested and proven implementations of tools for performing regular tasks makes sense for a whole host of reasons. Reinventing wheels which don't roll efficiently is not best practice... it's limiting, and it takes an unnecessarily long time. Whether you are using open source or proprietary tools to get your work done, these implementations have been honed by teams of individuals ensuring that you get your hands on the best quality instruments with which to accomplish your goals.\n\nHowever, there is often value in doing the dirty work yourself, even if as an educational endeavor. I wouldn't suggest coding your own distributed deep learning training framework from scratch -- at least, not normally -- but having gone through the trials and tribulations of writing up your own algorithm implementations and supporting tools from scratch at least once is a great idea. I could be wrong, but I don't think the vast majority of people learning machine learning, data science, artificial intelligence, or << insert related buzzword here >> today are actually doing this.\n\nSo let's build some machine learning workflows in Python. From scratch.\n\nWhat Do We Mean by \"From Scratch?\"\n\n\n\nFirst, let's clarify: when I say \"from scratch,\" I mean using as few helping hands as possible. It's all relative, but for our purposes I will draw the line this side of writing our own matrix, dataframe, and/or graphing libraries, and as such we will lean on numpy, pandas, and matplotlib, respectively. We won't even use all of the available functionality of these libraries in some cases, as we will see shortly, bypassing them in the name of better understanding. Anything in the standard Python library is also fair game. Beyond that, however, we're on our own.\n\nWe will need to start somewhere, and so this post will begin by looking at some simple data preparation tasks. We're going to start slowly, but ramp up quickly over the next few posts after we get a feel for what it is we're doing. Beyond data preparation, we will also need additional data transformation, results interpretation, and visualization tools -- not to mention machine learning algorithms -- to complete our journey, all of which we will get to.\n\nThe idea is to manually cobble together whatever non-trivial functionality we need to accomplish our machine learning tasks. As the series unfolds, we can add new tools and algorithms, as well as rethink some of our previous assumptions, making the entire process as much iterative as it will be progressive. Step by step, we will focus on what our goals are, strategize on how to accomplish them, implement them in Python, and then test them to see if they work.\n\nThe end result, as it is presently envisioned, will be a set of simple Python modules organized into our own simple machine learning library. For the uninitiated, I believe this will be invaluable experience toward understanding how machine learning processes, workflows, and algorithms work.\n\nWhat Do We Mean by Workflow?\n\n\n\nWorkflow can mean different things to different people, but we are generally talking about the entire process considered to be part of a machine learning project. There are numerous process frameworks which can help us keep track of what it is we are doing, but let's simplify things for now to include the following:\n\nGet some data\n\nProcess and/or prepare the data\n\nBuild a model\n\nInterpret the results\n\nWe can expand on these as we go, but this is our simple machine learning process framework for now. Also, \"pipeline\" implies the ability to chain workflow functionality together, and so we will also keep this in mind moving forward.\n\n\n\nVery simple machine learning process framework.\n\nGetting Our Data\n\n\n\nBefore we get to building any models, we need some data, and need to make sure this data conforms to some reasonable expectations. For testing purposes (not in the sense of training/testing, but testing our infrastructure), we will use the iris dataset, which you can download here. Given that various versions of the dataset can be found online, I suggest we all start from the same raw data in order to ensure all of our preparation steps work.\n\nLet's take a look:\n\nGiven what we know about such a simple dataset and its file, let's first think about what it is we will need to do to go from raw data to results:\n\nData is stored in CSV file\n\nInstances are made up mostly of numeric attribute values\n\nClass is categorical text\n\nNow, none of what is above is universally applicable to all datasets, but neither is any of it specific to this dataset. This affords us the opportunity to write code we can hopefully later re-use. Good coding practices we will focus on herein will include both reusability and modularity.\n\nSome simple exploratory data analysis is shown below.\n\n\n\nVery simple exploratory data analysis of the iris dataset: description of the dataset (above), and default attribute distribution histograms (below).\n\nPreparing Our Data\n\n\n\nWhile the data preparation we need in this particular scenario is minimal, there is still some needed. Specifically, we need to ensure that we account for the header row, remove any indexing that pandas automatically performs, and convert our class values from nominal to numeric. Since we have no nominal values in the features we will use for modeling, there will be no more complex transformations required -- at least, not yet.\n\nUltimately, we need a better data representation for our algorithm as well, and so we will make sure we end up with a matrix -- or numpy ndarray -- before we move on. Our data preparation workflow, then, should take the following form:\n\n\n\nVery simple data preparation process.\n\nAlso, note that there is no reason to believe that all interesting data is stored in comma separated files. We may want to grab data from a SQL database or directly from the web at some point, which we will come back to and visit in the future.\n\nFirst, let's write a simple function to load a CSV file into DataFrame; sure, it's simple to do inline, but thinking ahead we may want to add some additional steps to our dataset loading function in the future. Trust me here.\n\nThis code is quite straightforward. Reading data files line by line easily allows for some additional pre-processing, such as ignoring non-data lines (we are assuming comments in data files begin with '#' at the moment, however ridiculous). We can specify whether or not the dataset file includes a header, and we also allow for both CSV and TSV files, with CSV being the default.\n\nA bit of error checking exists, but it isn't terribly robust yet, so we may want to come back to this later. Also, reading a file line by line and making decisions on what to do with these lines one by one will be slower than using built-in functionality to read clean, conforming CSVs directly into a DataFrame, but the trade-off to allow for more flexibility is worth it at this stage (but may take considerably longer with larger files). Don't forget, if some of these inner workings don't seem like the best approach, we can always make changes later.\n\nBefore we try out our code, we need to first write a function to convert the nominal class values to numeric values. To generalize the function, we should allow it to be used on any attribute in the dataset, not only the class. We should also keep track of the mapping of attribute names to what will end up being integers. Given our previous step of loading CSV or TSV data files into pandas DataFrames, this function should accept both a pandas DataFrame as well as the attribute name to convert to numeric.\n\nAlso note that we are sidestepping a conversation about using one-hot encoding as relates to categorical non-class attributes, but I suspect we will return to that later.\n\nThe above function is, again, simple, but accomplishes what we want it to. We could have approached this task in a number of different ways, including using built-in functionality of pandas, but starting off by getting our hands a bit dirty is what this is all about.\n\nAt this point we can now load a dataset from file, and replace categorical attribute values with numeric values (we also keep a dictionary of those mappings for later). As previously mentioned, we want our dataset ultimately in the form of a numpy ndarray, in order to most easily use it with our algorithms. Again, a simple task, but making it a function will allow us to build on it in the future if necessary.\n\nEven if any of the preceding functions did not look like overkill, this one probably does. But bear with me; we're actually following sound -- if overly cautious -- programming principles. There is a good chance as we move forward that we will come up with changes or additions to the functions we have built thus far. Being able to implement these changes in one place, and have these changes well-documented, makes sense in the long term.\n\nTesting our Data Preparation Workflow\n\n\n\nOut workflow thus far may still be in building block form, but let's give our code a test.\n\nsepal_length sepal_width petal_length petal_width species 0 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa 1 4.9 3 1.4 0.2 setosa 2 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa 3 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa 4 5 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa sepal_length sepal_width petal_length petal_width species 0 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 0 1 4.9 3 1.4 0.2 0 2 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 0 3 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 0 4 5 3.6 1.4 0.2 0 {'setosa': 0, 'versicolor': 1, 'virginica': 2} [['5.1' '3.5' '1.4' '0.2' 0] ['4.9' '3' '1.4' '0.2' 0] ['4.7' '3.2' '1.3' '0.2' 0] ['4.6' '3.1' '1.5' '0.2' 0] ['5' '3.6' '1.4' '0.2' 0] ['5.4' '3.9' '1.7' '0.4' 0] ['4.6' '3.4' '1.4' '0.3' 0] ['5' '3.4' '1.5' '0.2' 0] ['4.4' '2.9' '1.4' '0.2' 0] ['4.9' '3.1' '1.5' '0.1' 0]]\n\n\n\n\n\nWith our code working as we hoped it would, let's do some quick house cleaning. We will come up with a more comprehensive organizational structure for our code once we get rolling, but for now we should add all of these functions to a single file, and save it as dataset.py. This will allow for more convenient reuse, which we will see next time.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\n\n\nNext, we will turn our attention to something of greater substance, an implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm. Then we will have a look at a simple classification algorithm, k-nearest neighbors. We will see how we can build both classification and clustering models in the context of our simple workflows. Undoubtedly, this will require coding some additional tools to help with out project, and I'm sure modifications will be needed to what we have done already.\n\nBut that's alright; practicing machine learning is the best prescription for understanding machine learning. Implementing the algorithms and support tools we need for our workflows should ultimately prove useful. I hope you have found this helpful enough to check the next installment.\n\n\n\nRelated:",

Wikipedia lists a few possible causes here:\n\nThe source is a subject matter expert, not a statistics expert.\n\nThe source is a statistician, not a subject matter expert.\n\nThe subject being studied is not well defined.\n\nData quality is poor.\n\nThe popular press has limited expertise and mixed motives.\n\n\u201cPoliticians use statistics in the same way that a drunk uses lamp-posts\u2014for support rather than illumination\u201d \u2013 Andrew Lang\n\nAnd to add one, as Andrew Anderson\u2019s tweet mentioned above, sometimes people are simply motivated to prove their points. Data can be a trump card when it comes to certain debates, so the message gets skewed by the messenger.\n\nThis goes beyond misinterpreting A/B testing statistics (though you should certainly brush up on the basics there). There are wider and broader offenses of data deception. And marketers don\u2019t just spread mistruths to others. We use data to lie to ourselves as well.\n\nTo be a better consumer and user of data, you should know these misdirections.\n\nHere are some of the most prevalent mistakes I\u2019ve seen.\n\nAlways Check the Sample\n\nWhen presented with an interesting statistic, one must examine how the data was collected.\n\nFor example, in A/B testing, since we can\u2019t measure \u2018true conversion rate,\u2019 we have to select a sample that is statistically representative of the whole. This applies for all methods of data collection, including surveys. Sampling is used to infer answers about the whole population.\n\nTo explain this, Matt Gershoff gives the example of cups of coffee. Say we have two cups of coffee and we want to know which one is hotter and by how much. All you need to do is measure the temperature of the two cups and subtract the lower temperature coffee from the higher one to see the difference. Very simple.\n\nBut if you wanted to discover, \u201cwhich place in my town has the hotter coffee, McDonald\u2019s or Starbucks?\u201d you\u2019d have a statistics question. Essentially, you\u2019d want to collect a representative sample that is large enough to infer the results of the whole population.\n\nThe more cups we measure, the more likely it is that the sample is representative of the actual temperature. The variance shrinks with a larger sample size, and it\u2019s more likely that our mean will be accurate.\n\nSo sampling can be a primary source of problems in bad data. It usually comes down to samples that are too small or unrepresentative of a population. In addition, it\u2019s easy to cherry pick your sample and your data to get the answer you\u2019d like.\n\nSmall Sample Sizes\n\nIn conversion optimization, it\u2019s easy to be fooled by small sample size. Often it comes in the form of celebratory case studies where the company \u201clifted conversions by 400%.\u201d As Tywman\u2019s Law suggests, if the data is too surprising, there\u2019s probably something wrong with it.\n\nThat\u2019s usually the case in experimentation. As Peep Laja, founder of CXL, put it in a previous blog post:\n\nPeep Laja: \u201cSo you ran a test where B beat A, and it was an impressive lift \u2013 perhaps +30%, +50% or even +100%. And then you look at the absolute numbers \u2013 and see that the sample size was something like 425 visitors. If B was 100% better, it could be 21 vs 42 conversions. So when we punch the numbers into a calculator, we can definitely see how this could be significant. BUT \u2013 hold your horses. Calculating statistical significance is an exercise is algebra, it\u2019s not telling you what the reality is. The thing is that since the sample size is so tiny (only 425 visitors), it\u2019s prone to change dramatically if you keep the experiment going and increase the sample (the lift either vanishes or becomes much smaller, regression toward the mean).\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why you\u2019ll see smart marketers calling out case studies with missing data or that seem too absurd to be true. That\u2019s why case studies on WhichTestWon or LeadPages were such a problem, especially for new marketers who have yet to develop a hardened, cynical worldview actually questions the results.\n\nTo combat this problem, first, check your own data and don\u2019t publish rubbish case studies. But on the consumption side, always be skeptical about other people\u2019s test results, especially if they seem too good to be true.\n\nUnrepresentative Samples\n\nSurveys are a major culprit of using unrepresentative \u201cconvenience\u201d samples (and small samples). That\u2019s why you should be especially skeptical when you\u2019re viewing the results of attitudinal surveys (\u201cX percent of people say Y\u201d).\n\nTomi Mester, who writes the Data36, blog gave an example of a fictional character, Clara, who needs to do research for a University class:\n\nTomi Mester\n\n\u201cProblem A) If she sends this out for her friends and ask them to share it, it won\u2019t represent the university\u2019s population, only her friends and maybe the friends of her friends. This is because she reaches her friends (and friends of friends) with a much higher probability, than everyone else. Do you see the issue? If Clara is sporty, then she will have friends from the basketball team (let\u2019s say), and the survey results will show that people are sporty at the university. But in reality the only thing turns out, that Clara\u2019s friends are sporty \u2014 no surprise, as she\u2019s sporty herself. Also if Clara is member of the local Book Club, then maybe most of her friends are focusing more on reading and learning . So no surprise that the survey results are, that \u201call the university students\u201d are focusing on learning as well\u2026\u201d\n\nCherry Picking Segments or Biasing Samples\n\nThis is pretty similar to the above case of unrepresentative samples, but it\u2019s a bit more conscious. Essentially, if you want to make a point, you can pollute the sample with biased measurements, or you can cherry pick after the fact to prove your point.\n\nMarket researchers \u2013 well, marketers in general \u2013 can be deceiving from the start. If you choose a sample that is likely to be skewed attitudinally in your favor, it\u2019s very easy to come up with nice marketing sound bites.\n\nIf you only survey your best customers, it\u2019s easy to find that most of them prefer your software to others.\n\nIf you only analyze top cohorts, it\u2019s easy to prove your campaign is effective.\n\nIf you only look at top performing segments in an experiment, it\u2019s easy to call it a winner.\n\nProper sampling is hard to do, especially the further you venture out into the real world as opposed to lab controlled experiments. When data simply sounds weird, question the sampling. When you analyze your own data, be careful not to cherry pick to prove your points. In summary, know that much of the questionable data you read about in news stories has a solid chance of being affected by bad sampling. From How to Lie with Statistics:\n\nDarrell Huff: \u201cIf your sample is large enough and selected properly, it will represent the whole well enough for most purposes. If it is not, it may be far less accurate than an intelligent guess and have nothing to recommend it but a spurious air of scientific precision. It is sad truth that conclusions from such samples, biased or too small or both, lie behind much of what we read or think we know.\u201d\n\nCorrelations \u2260 Causation\n\nOne of the easiest ways to be fooled by data is to assume that correlation implies causation. Just because two variables have a high correlational coefficient does not mean they\u2019re related in a meaningful way, let alone causal.\n\nSome of my favorite examples come from a website that chronicles spurious correlations. This one shows that Nicholas Cage movies are highly correlated with swimming pool drownings:\n\nCorrelational data can be valuable, especially in experiment ideation. Say you find that people who download a certain PDF are worth much more money to you over the long term. Well, a simple experiment would attempt to get more people to download the PDF and see what the results are.\n\nThe problem, though, is when you take these correlational observations at face value. Ronny Kohavi, Distinguished Engineer at Microsoft, gave the following example in a recent presentation:\n\nThe larger your palm, the shorter you will live, on average (with high statistical significance).\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t believe there\u2019s any causality in this case, right? Of course not. There\u2019s a common cause: women have smaller palms and live six years longer on average.\n\nAs Kohavi put it, \u201cobviously you wouldn\u2019t have believed that palm size is causal, but how about observational studies about features in products reducing churn?\u201d\n\nIn addition, these sorts of correlations turn up all the time in popular media. \u201cX is associated with Y.\u201d\n\nJordan Ellenberg gave an example in How Not to Be Wrong: say you have two binary variables \u201care you a smoker?\u201d and \u201care you married?\u201d\n\nYou find, after doing this research (with the proper and representative sample) that smokers are less likely than the average person to be married. This gets reported as such, and that\u2019s where the confusion starts. As Ellenberg puts it, you can safely express this by saying, \u201cif you\u2019re a smoker, you\u2019re less likely to be married.\u201d\n\nBut one small change to this sentence would make the meaning very different, \u201cif you were a smoker, you\u2019d be less likely to be married.\u201d\n\nThe second statement infers causality, which the original study did nothing to confirm. But when reading a sound bite like that, many would understand it to be the latter statement: \u201cif you smoke, you\u2019re more likely to be single.\u201d\n\nPost Hoc and Other Storytelling Methods\n\nPost hoc ergo propter hoc, or \u201cafter this, therefore, because of this,\u201d is a post hoc fallacy that establishes causation where there is only correlation. It looks backward in time and says, \u201cthis happened earlier, therefore it caused what followed to happen.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s essentially a narrative fallacy, a method of storytelling by which you can explain past events, though your explanations likely have no bearing on reality.\n\nThe best explanation I\u2019ve found of this comes from The West Wing:\n\nCandide by Voltaire also makes a comical case of the post hoc fallacy:\n\n\u201cIt is demonstrable that things cannot be otherwise than as they are; for as all things have been created for some end, they must necessarily be created for the best end. Observe, for instance, the nose is formed for spectacles, therefore we wear spectacles.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy in marketing to say that certain actions caused certain results. Often, though, it\u2019s simple storytelling.\n\nFor instance, analytics data tends to be seasonal. So if you\u2019re starting your work at the bottom of a peak, it\u2019s very like that any action will make it look like it\u2019s increasing your metrics:\n\nThis is largely why we A/B test in the first place. If we could simply change things on the site and measure their impact, without the impact of seasonality and external validity factors, life would be much easier.\n\nBut if you change your hero image (without testing) and your conversion rate goes up, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the hero image change caused that. \u201cPost hoc, ergo proctor hoc.\u201d\n\nAverages Can Lie\n\nAs the joke goes, \u201cBill Gates walks into a bar and everyone inside becomes a millionaire\u2026on average.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the thing about the word average. Technically, it can mean a few different things. Colloquially, it\u2019s less formal and tends towards meaning \u201cprototypical,\u201d or \u201cmost people,\u201d or the most common representative of a set.\n\nBut mathematically, an average can be three different things:\n\nMean average\n\nMedian average\n\nMode average\n\nIf you have a set of numbers, say 3, 3, 5, 4, and 7, the mean would be 4.4 ((3+3+5+4+7)/5), the median would be 4 (since two of the numbers are higher than 4 and two are lower), and the mode would be 3 (since it occurs most frequently).\n\nWhile they all have their appropriate use cases for understanding data, problems occur when you choose one that misrepresents a data set. Most commonly, that occurs when a data set has a few outliers that skew the mean (such as with the Bill Gates example).\n\nA frequent example is with average salaries. Salary tends to be a metric that doesn\u2019t fall on a normal distribution \u2013 rather, a few people make a ton of money and that skews the mean.\n\nOutliers can affect A/B test results as well, particular when you\u2019re optimizing for a metric like average order value or revenue per visitor.\n\nI wrote a whole article on dealing with outliers in data a while back that goes through specific solutions, especially with regard to A/B testing.\n\nAverages can also mute your insights at times. Average click-through-rates, bounce rates, conversion rates, customer satisfaction numbers don\u2019t tell a ton (which is why I\u2019m not a fan of NPS in its aggregate form).\n\nIn addition, average conversion rates can, at times, hide gold mines of insights. So, look at the segments (but be careful not to cherrypick and make sure to account for multiple comparisons problem). These insights can be the beginning steps of a robust personalization program. As Peep put it in a previous article:\n\nPeep Laja: \u201cAlways keep in mind that only looking at average numbers in your analysis will lead you astray. There are no average visitors\u2014you must segment ruthlessly. Look at new vs. returning visitors, check performance across different devices and browsers, and buyers vs. non-buyers. What\u2019s working for one segment might not work for another, and personalization could make you a ton of money.\u201d\n\nCommon Data Visualization Tricks to Watch Out For\n\nThis is a whole section because it\u2019s so easy to manipulate data by visualizing it. Data visualization is about storytelling, and it can be used for good or for evil. Most often, data visualization is simply inept and you\u2019re looking at convoluted charts that mean nothing to anyone except the analyst.\n\nFrom time to time, you get some beautiful dataviz work like this (Berlin subway map compared to its real geography):\n\nBut then it also happens that you get some visualizations like this:\n\nFunnily enough, a lot of the offenders are prominent journalists and media outlets. It\u2019s unclear whether they\u2019re simply unaware of their offense of if they\u2019re purposely propelling these misleading graphs into the public to get more clicks.\n\nBut in any case, the visualization tends to be a primary source of confusion and misrepresentations of reality. Here are some of my favorite offenders\u2026\n\nPie Charts\n\nThere are more ways pie charts can go wrong than go right. That\u2019s why they are almost universally derided by analysts. When in doubt, it\u2019s usually smart to avoid pie charts.\n\nWhy? They\u2019re hard to read. They can easily distort proportions. Look at this example comparing pie charts that are seemingly the same, yet the corresponding bar charts show a much different story.\n\nIt\u2019s even worse when they\u2019re 3D pie charts, as the emphasis is largely misrepresented by the closer segments of the pie. For example, this chart makes it seems as if the teal and red portions are about the same size, even though in terms of quantity, red is a decent amount lower:\n\nThat\u2019s not to say pie charts are always bad all the time, though. They\u2019re great for demonstrating simple proportions:\n\n.@inivri Exactly, thank you! Pie charts are useful for showing simple proportions like this. pic.twitter.com/Rsg7e6ilBR \u2014 Randy Olson (@randal_olson) November 5, 2015\n\nCropped Axes\n\nIf you want to make the difference between two data sets look larger than it actually is, truncate the chart. Here\u2019s an example from Data36:\n\nHuge difference, right? Well, here\u2019s the same data with the Y axis starting at zero:\n\nHow you visualize data can have a massive effect on how the recipient of the data interprets it. That\u2019s why data visualization is such an important skill set for an analysts. Whether because of ignorance or malice, poor data visualization can cripple understanding.\n\nHere\u2019s the graph from Fox News:\n\nBut here\u2019s what it should look like:\n\nConclusion\n\n\u201cThere are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.\u201d \u2013 Benjamin Disraeli\n\nJust because it\u2019s \u201cdata\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it is truthful. Just because it\u2019s quantitative doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s objective.\n\nI\u2019ve gone over some common examples of data abuse in this post, but the more important point is: be skeptical. Question data. Be curious. You don\u2019t need to accept things at face value.\n\nAs a citizen and consumer of data, being critical helps you sift out truth in the world. As a marketer, optimizer, or analyst, it helps you make sure you\u2019re delivering truth in the world. It\u2019s a crucial skill set.",

            "text": "How Airbnb Democratizes Data Science With Data University\n\nBy Jeff Feng, Erin Coffman & Elena Grewal\n\nIntroduction\n\nData is essential to us at Airbnb. We characterize data as the voice of our users at scale. Thus, data science plays the role of an interpreter \u2014 we use data and statistics to understand our users and translate it to a voice that people or machines can understand. We leverage these quantitative insights, paired together with qualitative insights (e.g. in-person user research) to make the best possible decisions for both the business and our community of hosts and guests.\n\nTo that, we have built a world-class Data Science Team that has scaled to nearly 100 people strong working on everything from experimentation to data analysis & visualization to modeling & machine learning. We also built a stable, reliable and scalable data infrastructure to serve as the foundation for our data, as well as a powerful suite of data tools to empower data scientists and knowledge workers all across Airbnb:\n\nScaling & Democratizing Data Science\n\nAnother one of our fundamental beliefs is that every employee should be empowered to make data informed decisions. This applies to all parts of Airbnb\u2019s organization \u2014 from deciding whether to launch a new product feature to analyzing how to provide the best possible employee experience. Our Data Science team firmly believes that part of our goal is to empower the company to understand and work with data. In order to inform every decision with data, it wouldn\u2019t be possible to have a data scientist in every room \u2014 we needed to scale our skillset. Additionally, our rapid international growth made the situation even more challenging. We expanded from one office in San Francisco in 2011 to 22 offices internationally today, many of which do not have Data Science presence. Furthermore, we believe that people have the capability to think critically and understand the data on their own, and we wanted to give them the tools to do it.\n\nTo address this challenge, we thought deeply about how to democratize data science and scale data informed decision making during the 2nd half of 2016. We used a metric of weekly active users (WAUs) of our data platform as a proxy to how \u201cdata informed\u201d we were as an organization. At the beginning of Q3 2016, only about 30% of Airbnb employees were a WAU of our data platform, which was significantly lower than other hypergrowth internet company peers we benchmarked with like Facebook and Dropbox.\n\nWe then thought about what might be holding back our company from looking at data themselves.\n\nThe key ingredients needed for data informed decision making included having accessibility to data, a comprehensive set of data tools and user knowledge of how to utilize the data and tools. As we spoke to people throughout Airbnb, it became more and more apparent that the bottleneck to scaling data informed decisions was actually data education for users. Our data tools were serving Data Scientists well. Also, we had already made huge strides in making data more accessible through efforts like Core Data, our single source of truth for product data, as well as SQL Lab, a new SQL editor we built into Superset. The gap was that we didn\u2019t have any formal programs to equip employees with the knowledge to use our tools and how to work with Core Data. Thus, we decided to create Data University.\n\nOur Solution: Data University\n\nVideo credit: ReadyState\n\nData University is data education for anyone at Airbnb that scales by role and team. Our vision is to empower every employee to make data informed decisions. Our approach is unique since organizations offering data education typically focus just on their technical employees. Our approach is also intentional because we believe that every person at Airbnb should and can utilize data in his/her role to make better decisions. Thus, we designed the program to make it accessible and relevant to anyone at Airbnb.\n\nCreating \u201ccitizen data scientists\u201d is powerful \u2014 not only does it help ensure that decisions are grounded in data, but it enables people to make decisions autonomously. This is important because the person asking the question always has the best context on the question they are trying to answer, and it reduces the feedback loop to answering questions. This also has the side benefit of freeing up some of the Data Science Team\u2019s time. We had considered leveraging existing resources from MOOCs such as Coursera and Udacity, however many of our data tools are unique, and we believe there is tremendous value in educating people in the context of Airbnb\u2019s data.\n\nThe Data University Curriculum\n\nThe curriculum consists of over 30 classes covering an array of different topics. The 100-level series provides the foundation for data informed decision making at Airbnb and was designed to be accessible to everyone. The 200-level series equips people with the applied skills for accessing data using SQL, or analyzing and visualizing data using tools such as Superset, Tableau and ERF in the context of Airbnb data. Then, the 300-level series is targeted primarily towards engineers and data scientists. It exposes people to advanced data techniques such as machine learning and tools such as Airflow for writing data pipelines. We also cover popular languages such as R, Python and Hive for analyzing and manipulating data.\n\nThe Data University Faculty\n\nMany of the initial classes were developed and taught by Erin Coffman, our most tenured Data Scientist at Airbnb. However, since then we have amassed more than 30 volunteer faculty (many pictured below) from across the Data Science and Engineering organizations to help create course content as well as teach classes. We are incredibly grateful for all the volunteers who make Data University possible!\n\nThe Impact: Democratizing Data Science\n\nData University has been a huge success thus far at Airbnb. In the first half year since it launched, more than 500 unique people have participated in at least one class (or about 1/8th of Airbnb). Depth of engagement is high as each employee who has participated has taken more than 4 classes on average as we have had a total of over 2,100 \u201cbutts in seats.\u201d Every class offered thus far has an NPS score of +55 or higher.\n\nFurthermore, it has completely transformed Airbnb\u2019s data culture as 45% of Airbnb is now a WAU of the data platform. Ad hoc data requests that used to go to Data Scientists or Analysts are now often being self-serviced or addressed by other Data University graduates. We routinely hear anecdotes about employees being empowered with data, from employees in recruiting creating Tableau dashboards to Product Managers writing their own SQL and interpreting their own experiments. Most recently, we have begun scaling the program to other offices including Dublin, Portland, Singapore and Seoul.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nOur team is really encouraged about the initial results of Data University, and we will continue to iterate on the content as well as scale the program both in terms of breadth of classes (the 300-level series is next) and locations where the curriculum is offered. We will also be experimenting with different learning formats such as online and/or streamed courses.\n\nIn sharing our experience, we hope to inspire other organizations working on the same kinds of problems of scale and data democratization that we are trying to solve, as well as share learnings so that we can collaboratively produce best practices. If you\u2019re interested in exchanging notes, or have follow up questions about our approach, please reach out!\n\nCheck out all of our open source projects over at airbnb.io and follow us on Twitter: @AirbnbData + @AirbnbEng",
